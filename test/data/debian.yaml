    curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM authentication
    code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the
    password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the
    heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate
    output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to
    calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31
    bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated
    instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap
    buffer overflow. (This bug is almost identical to CVE-2017-8816.)

    The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not
    correctly handled in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49
    and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the
    constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain
    access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security
    constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.

    Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to
    9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 were only applied once a
    Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL
    pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets
    were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed
    resources to users who were not authorised to access them.

    An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with supplementary characters can
    lead to an infinite loop in the decoder causing a Denial of Service. Versions Affected:
    Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M9 to 9.0.7, 8.5.0 to 8.5.30, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.51, and 7.0.28 to
    7.0.86.

    The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client was missing. It is now
    enabled by default. Versions Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.9, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31,
    8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, and 7.0.35 to 7.0.88.

    If an async request was completed by the application at the same time as the container
    triggered the async timeout, a race condition existed that could result in a user seeing a
    response intended for a different user. An additional issue was present in the NIO and
    NIO2 connectors that did not correctly track the closure of the connection when an async
    request was completed by the application and timed out by the container at the same time.
    This could also result in a user seeing a response intended for another user. Versions
    Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M9 to 9.0.9 and 8.5.5 to 8.5.31.

    In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x
    (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), HTTP/0.9 is handled poorly.
    An HTTP/1 style request line (i.e. method space URI space version) that declares a version
    of HTTP/0.9 was accepted and treated as a 0.9 request. If deployed behind an intermediary
    that also accepted and passed through the 0.9 version (but did not act on it), then the
    response sent could be interpreted by the intermediary as HTTP/1 headers. This could be
    used to poison the cache if the server allowed the origin client to generate arbitrary
    content in the response.

    In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x
    (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding chunks are
    handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a
    large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk
    body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an
    intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily
    large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the
    authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be
    interpreted by the intermediary as a request.

    In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.x
    configurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presented with two
    content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presented with a content-length
    and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an
    intermediary decided on the shorter length, but still passed on the longer body, then body
    content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary was
    imposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass that authorization.

    Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and address translations may

    Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and address translations may
    allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache to an attacker
    with local user access with guest OS privilege via a terminal page fault and a
    side-channel analysis.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The DEBUGCTL MSR contains several debugging
    features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some do not. In particular, Branch Trace
    Store is not virtualised by the processor, and software has to be careful to configure it
    suitably not to lock up the core. As a result, it must only be available to fully trusted
    guests. Unfortunately, in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking was skipped,
    allowing the guest to choose any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes. A malicious or buggy guest
    administrator (on Intel x86 HVM or PVH) can lock up the entire host, causing a Denial of
    Service.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. ARM never properly implemented grant table
    v2, either in the hypervisor or in Linux. Unfortunately, an ARM guest can still request v2
    grant tables; they will simply not be properly set up, resulting in subsequent
    grant-related hypercalls hitting BUG() checks. An unprivileged guest can cause a BUG()
    check in the hypervisor, resulting in a denial-of-service (crash).

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The logic in oxenstored for handling writes
    depended on the order of evaluation of expressions making up a tuple. As indicated in
    section 7.7.3 "Operations on data structures" of the OCaml manual, the order of evaluation
    of subexpressions is not specified. In practice, different implementations behave
    differently. Thus, oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity. This allows
    a malicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries as it wishes, causing
    unbounded memory usage in oxenstored. This can lead to a system-wide DoS.

  description: |
    A vulnerability was found in libpq, the default PostgreSQL client library where libpq
    failed to properly reset its internal state between connections. If an affected version of
    libpq was used with "host" or "hostaddr" connection parameters from untrusted input,
    attackers could bypass client-side connection security features, obtain access to higher
    privileged connections or potentially cause other impact through SQL injection, by causing
    the PQescape() functions to malfunction. Postgresql versions before 10.5, 9.6.10, 9.5.14,
    9.4.19, and 9.3.24 are affected.

    It was discovered that PostgreSQL versions before 10.5, 9.6.10, 9.5.14, 9.4.19, and 9.3.24
    failed to properly check authorization on certain statements involved with "INSERT ... ON
    CONFLICT DO UPDATE". An attacker with "CREATE TABLE" privileges could exploit this to read
    arbitrary bytes server memory. If the attacker also had certain "INSERT" and limited
    "UPDATE" privileges to a particular table, they could exploit this to update other columns
    in the same table.

  description: |
    Symfony before 2.8.6 and 3.x before 3.0.6 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication
    by logging in with an empty password and valid username, which triggers an unauthenticated
    bind.

    An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.38, 2.8.x before 2.8.31, 3.2.x before
    3.2.14, and 3.3.x before 3.3.13. DefaultAuthenticationSuccessHandler or
    DefaultAuthenticationFailureHandler takes the content of the _target_path parameter and
    generates a redirect response, but no check is performed on the path, which could be an
    absolute URL to an external domain. This Open redirect vulnerability can be exploited for
    example to mount effective phishing attacks.

    An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and
    4.0-BETA5. The current implementation of CSRF protection in Symfony (Version >=2) does not
    use different tokens for HTTP and HTTPS; therefore the token is subject to MITM attacks on
    HTTP and can then be used in an HTTPS context to do CSRF attacks.

    An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and
    4.0-BETA5. The Intl component includes various bundle readers that are used to read
    resource bundles from the local filesystem. The read() methods of these classes use a path
    and a locale to determine the language bundle to retrieve. The locale argument value is
    commonly retrieved from untrusted user input (like a URL parameter). An attacker can use
    this argument to navigate to arbitrary directories via the dot-dot-slash attack, aka
    Directory Traversal.

    An issue was discovered in Symfony before 2.7.38, 2.8.31, 3.2.14, 3.3.13, 3.4-BETA5, and
    4.0-BETA5. When a form is submitted by the user, the request handler classes of the Form
    component merge POST data and uploaded files data into one array. This big array forms the
    data that are then bound to the form. At this stage there is no difference anymore between
    submitted POST data and uploaded files. A user can send a crafted HTTP request where the
    value of a "FileType" is sent as normal POST data that could be interpreted as a local
    file path on the server-side (for example, "file:///etc/passwd"). If the application did
    not perform any additional checks about the value submitted to the "FileType", the
    contents of the given file on the server could have been exposed to the attacker.

    An issue was discovered in the Security component in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.48, 2.8.x
    before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11. A
    session fixation vulnerability within the "Guard" login feature may allow an attacker to
    impersonate a victim towards the web application if the session id value was previously
    known to the attacker.

    An issue was discovered in the HttpFoundation component in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.48,
    2.8.x before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11.
    The PDOSessionHandler class allows storing sessions on a PDO connection. Under some
    configurations and with a well-crafted payload, it was possible to do a denial of service
    on a Symfony application without too much resources.

    An issue was discovered in the Security component in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.48, 2.8.x
    before 2.8.41, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.11, and 4.0.x before 4.0.11. By
    default, a user's session is invalidated when the user is logged out. This behavior can be
    disabled through the invalidate_session option. In this case, CSRF tokens were not erased
    during logout which allowed for CSRF token fixation.

    Syntastic (aka vim-syntastic) through 3.9.0 does not properly handle searches for

    improper handling might be exploited for arbitrary code execution via a malicious gcc
    plugin, if an attacker has write access to a directory that is a parent of the base
    directory of the project being checked. NOTE: exploitation is more difficult after 3.8.0
    because filename prediction may be needed.

    Ruby before 2.4.3 allows Net::FTP command injection. Net::FTP#get, getbinaryfile,
    gettextfile, put, putbinaryfile, and puttextfile use Kernel#open to open a local file. If
    the localfile argument starts with the "|" pipe character, the command following the pipe
    character is executed. The default value of localfile is File.basename(remotefile), so
    malicious FTP servers could cause arbitrary command execution.

    Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before 2.5.1, and
    2.6.0-preview1 allows an HTTP Response Splitting attack. An attacker can inject a crafted
    key and value into an HTTP response for the HTTP server of WEBrick.

    The lazy_initialize function in lib/resolv.rb in Ruby through 2.4.3 uses Kernel#open,
    which might allow Command Injection attacks, as demonstrated by a Resolv::Hosts::new
    argument beginning with a '|' character, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-17405.
    NOTE: situations with untrusted input may be highly unlikely.

    Directory traversal vulnerability in the Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir library in Ruby
    before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before 2.5.1, and
    2.6.0-preview1 might allow attackers to create arbitrary directories or files via a ..
    (dot dot) in the prefix argument.

    In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before 2.5.1, and
    2.6.0-preview1, an attacker can pass a large HTTP request with a crafted header to WEBrick
    server or a crafted body to WEBrick server/handler and cause a denial of service (memory
    consumption).

    In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before 2.5.1, and
    2.6.0-preview1, an attacker controlling the unpacking format (similar to format string
    vulnerabilities) can trigger a buffer under-read in the String#unpack method, resulting in
    a massive and controlled information disclosure.

    In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before 2.5.1, and
    2.6.0-preview1, the UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open methods are not checked for null
    characters. It may be connected to an unintended socket.

    In Ruby before 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, 2.4.x before 2.4.4, 2.5.x before 2.5.1, and
    2.6.0-preview1, the Dir.open, Dir.new, Dir.entries and Dir.empty? methods do not check
    NULL characters. When using the corresponding method, unintentional directory traversal
    may be performed.

  description: |
    In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is vulnerable to a
    restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows non-root users to mount a FUSE file
    system with the 'allow_other' mount option regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set
    in the fuse configuration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system,
    accessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file system,
    possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.

    The filter_slice function in libavfilter/vf_transpose.c in FFmpeg through 3.4.1 allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-array access) via a crafted MP4
    file.

    The decode_frame function in libavcodec/utvideodec.c in FFmpeg through 3.4.1 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (out of array read) via a crafted AVI file.

    The decode_init function in libavcodec/utvideodec.c in FFmpeg through 3.4.2 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (Out of array read) via an AVI file with crafted
    dimensions within chroma subsampling data.

    The decode_init function in libavcodec/utvideodec.c in FFmpeg through 3.4.2 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (out of array read) via an AVI file.

    An improper integer type in the mpeg4_encode_gop_header function in
    libavcodec/mpeg4videoenc.c in FFmpeg 4.0 may trigger an assertion violation while
    converting a crafted AVI file to MPEG4, leading to a denial of service.

    In FFmpeg 4.0.1, an improper argument (AVCodecParameters) passed to the
    avpriv_request_sample function in the handle_eac3 function in libavformat/movenc.c may
    trigger an out-of-array read while converting a crafted AVI file to MPEG4, leading to a
    denial of service and possibly an information disclosure.

    In FFmpeg 4.0.1, improper handling of frame types (other than EAC3_FRAME_TYPE_INDEPENDENT)
    that have multiple independent substreams in the handle_eac3 function in
    libavformat/movenc.c may trigger an out-of-array access while converting a crafted AVI
    file to MPEG4, leading to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.

    FFmpeg before commit a7e032a277452366771951e29fd0bf2bd5c029f0 contains a use-after-free
    vulnerability in the realmedia demuxer that can result in vulnerability allows attacker to
    read heap memory. This attack appear to be exploitable via specially crafted RM file has
    to be provided as input. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in
    a7e032a277452366771951e29fd0bf2bd5c029f0 and later.

    FFmpeg before commit 9807d3976be0e92e4ece3b4b1701be894cd7c2e1 contains a CWE-835: Infinite
    loop vulnerability in pva format demuxer that can result in a Vulnerability that allows
    attackers to consume excessive amount of resources like CPU and RAM. This attack appear to
    be exploitable via specially crafted PVA file has to be provided as input. This
    vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 9807d3976be0e92e4ece3b4b1701be894cd7c2e1 and
    later.

    FFmpeg before commit cced03dd667a5df6df8fd40d8de0bff477ee02e8 contains multiple out of
    array access vulnerabilities in the mms protocol that can result in attackers accessing
    out of bound data. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity. This
    vulnerability appears to have been fixed in cced03dd667a5df6df8fd40d8de0bff477ee02e8 and
    later.

    Insufficient restriction of IPP filters in CUPS in Google Chrome OS prior to 62.0.3202.74
    allowed a remote attacker to execute a command with the same privileges as the cups daemon
    via a crafted PPD file, aka a printer zeroconfig CRLF issue.

    The CUPS AppArmor profile incorrectly confined the dnssd backend due to use of hard links.
    A local attacker could possibly use this issue to escape confinement. This flaw affects
    versions prior to 2.2.7-1ubuntu2.1 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, prior to 2.2.4-7ubuntu3.1 in
    Ubuntu 17.10, prior to 2.1.3-4ubuntu0.5 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and prior to
    1.7.2-0ubuntu1.10 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

    In PHP through 5.6.33, 7.0.x before 7.0.28, 7.1.x through 7.1.14, and 7.2.x through 7.2.2,
    there is a stack-based buffer under-read while parsing an HTTP response in the
    php_stream_url_wrap_http_ex function in ext/standard/http_fopen_wrapper.c. This
    subsequently results in copying a large string.

    An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.35, 7.0.x before 7.0.29, 7.1.x before 7.1.16,
    and 7.2.x before 7.2.4. Dumpable FPM child processes allow bypassing opcache access
    controls because fpm_unix.c makes a PR_SET_DUMPABLE prctl call, allowing one user (in a
    multiuser environment) to obtain sensitive information from the process memory of a second
    user's PHP applications by running gcore on the PID of the PHP-FPM worker process.

    An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17,
    and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. An infinite loop exists in ext/iconv/iconv.c because the iconv
    stream filter does not reject invalid multibyte sequences.

    An issue was discovered in ext/phar/phar_object.c in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before
    7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. There is Reflected XSS on the PHAR
    403 and 404 error pages via request data of a request for a .phar file. NOTE: this
    vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-5712.

    An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17,
    and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. ext/ldap/ldap.c allows remote LDAP servers to cause a denial of
    service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) because of mishandling of the
    ldap_get_dn return value.

    An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17,
    and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. exif_read_data in ext/exif/exif.c has an out-of-bounds read for
    crafted JPEG data because exif_iif_add_value mishandles the case of a MakerNote that lacks
    a final '\0' character.

    In types.cpp in Exiv2 0.26, a large size value may lead to a SIGABRT during an attempt at
    memory allocation for an Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::zlibUncompress call.

    An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.26. readMetadata in jp2image.cpp allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (SIGABRT) by triggering an incorrect Safe::add
    call.

    An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.26. The Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::parseTXTChunk
    function has a heap-based buffer over-read.

    Exiv2 0.26 has a heap-based buffer overflow in getData in preview.cpp.

    Exiv2 0.26 has integer overflows in LoaderTiff::getData() in preview.cpp, leading to an
    out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::ValueType::setDataArea in value.hpp.

  description: |
    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. Certain PV MMU operations may take a long
    time to process. For that reason Xen explicitly checks for the need to preempt the current
    vCPU at certain points. A few rarely taken code paths did bypass such checks. By suitably
    enforcing the conditions through its own page table contents, a malicious guest may cause
    such bypasses to be used for an unbounded number of iterations. A malicious or buggy PV
    guest may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may
    prevent use of a physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time. All Xen versions from
    3.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and earlier are vulnerable to an even wider
    class of attacks, due to them lacking preemption checks altogether in the affected code
    paths. Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. Only multi-vCPU x86 PV
    guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM or PVH guests as well as x86 single-vCPU PV
    ones cannot leverage the vulnerability.

    An issue was discovered in Xen 4.7 through 4.10.x. libxl fails to pass the readonly flag
    to qemu when setting up a SCSI disk, due to what was probably an erroneous merge conflict
    resolution. Malicious guest administrators or (in some situations) users may be able to
    write to supposedly read-only disk images. Only emulated SCSI disks (specified as "sd" in
    the libxl disk configuration, or an equivalent) are affected. IDE disks ("hd") are not
    affected (because attempts to make them readonly are rejected). Additionally, CDROM
    devices (that is, devices specified to be presented to the guest as CDROMs, regardless of
    the nature of the backing storage on the host) are not affected; they are always read
    only. Only systems using qemu-xen (rather than qemu-xen-traditional) as the device model
    version are vulnerable. Only systems using libxl or libxl-based toolstacks are vulnerable.
    (This includes xl, and libvirt with the libxl driver.) The vulnerability is present in Xen
    versions 4.7 and later. (In earlier versions, provided that the patch for XSA-142 has been
    applied, attempts to create read only disks are rejected.) If the host and guest together
    usually support PVHVM, the issue is exploitable only if the malicious guest administrator
    has control of the guest kernel or guest kernel command line.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. One of the fixes in XSA-260 added some
    safety checks to help prevent Xen livelocking with debug exceptions. Unfortunately, due to
    an oversight, at least one of these safety checks can be triggered by a guest. A malicious
    PV guest can crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service. All Xen systems which have applied
    the XSA-260 fix are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not
    vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests
    cannot exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to control hardware
    debugging facilities to exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically
    available to unprivileged users.

    Memory Corruption was discovered in the cmsgpack library in the Lua subsystem in Redis
    before 3.2.12, 4.x before 4.0.10, and 5.x before 5.0 RC2 because of stack-based buffer
    overflows.

    An Integer Overflow issue was discovered in the struct library in the Lua subsystem in
    Redis before 3.2.12, 4.x before 4.0.10, and 5.x before 5.0 RC2, leading to a failure of
    bounds checking.

    Buffer overflow in redis-cli of Redis before 4.0.10 and 5.x before 5.0 RC3 allows an
    attacker to achieve code execution and escalate to higher privileges via a crafted command
    line. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common situations in which redis-cli is
    used with, for example, a -h (aka hostname) argument from an untrusted source.

    on file descriptor 2 to other programs that use the "--status-fd 2" option. For example,
    the OpenPGP data might represent an original filename that contains line feed characters
    in conjunction with GOODSIG or VALIDSIG status codes.

    The try_read_command function in memcached.c in memcached before 1.4.39 allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request to add/set a
    key, which makes a comparison between signed and unsigned int and triggers a heap-based
    buffer over-read. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
    CVE-2016-8705.

    Memcached version 1.5.5 contains an Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume
    (Network Amplification, CWE-406) vulnerability in the UDP support of the memcached server
    that can result in denial of service via network flood (traffic amplification of 1:50,000
    has been reported by reliable sources). This attack appear to be exploitable via network
    connectivity to port 11211 UDP. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.5.6 due
    to the disabling of the UDP protocol by default.

    memcached version prior to 1.4.37 contains an Integer Overflow vulnerability in
    items.c:item_free() that can result in data corruption and deadlocks due to items existing
    in hash table being reused from free list. This attack appear to be exploitable via
    network connectivity to the memcached service. This vulnerability appears to have been
    fixed in 1.4.37 and later.

    In Apache Batik before 1.9, files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik
    can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types
    that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is
    running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or
    sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of
    the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially
    trigger an amplification attack.

    In Apache Batik 1.x before 1.10, when deserializing subclass of `AbstractDocument`, the
    class takes a string from the inputStream as the class name which then use it to call the
    no-arg constructor of the class. Fix was to check the class type before calling

  description: |
    Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect branch
    prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user
    access via a side-channel analysis.

    Race condition in the v9fs_xattrwalk function in hw/9pfs/9p.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator)
    allows local guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host heap memory via
    vectors related to reading extended attributes.

    The Network Block Device (NBD) server in Quick Emulator (QEMU) before 2.11 is vulnerable
    to a denial of service issue. It could occur if a client sent large option requests,
    making the server waste CPU time on reading up to 4GB per request. A client could use this
    flaw to keep the NBD server from serving other requests, resulting in DoS.

    VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator (QEMU) 2.11.0 and older was found to be
    vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did not throttle the framebuffer
    updates sent to its client. If the client did not consume these updates, VNC server
    allocates growing memory to hold onto this data. A malicious remote VNC client could use
    this flaw to cause DoS to the server host.

    Qemu through 2.10.0 allows remote attackers to cause a memory leak by triggering slow
    data-channel read operations, related to io/channel-websock.c.

    The mode4and5 write functions in hw/display/cirrus_vga.c in Qemu allow local OS guest
    privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write access and Qemu process
    crash) via vectors related to dst calculation.

    hw/input/ps2.c in Qemu does not validate 'rptr' and 'count' values during guest migration,
    leading to out-of-bounds access.

    The Virtio Vring implementation in QEMU allows local OS guest users to cause a denial of
    service (divide-by-zero error and QEMU process crash) by unsetting vring alignment while
    updating Virtio rings.

    Integer overflow in the macro ROUND_UP (n, d) in Quick Emulator (Qemu) allows a user to
    cause a denial of service (Qemu process crash).

    The vga_draw_text function in Qemu allows local OS guest privileged users to cause a
    denial of service (out-of-bounds read and QEMU process crash) by leveraging improper
    memory address validation.

    The load_multiboot function in hw/i386/multiboot.c in Quick Emulator (aka QEMU) allows
    local guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via a mh_load_end_addr
    value greater than mh_bss_end_addr, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write memory
    access.

    In Git before 2.13.7, 2.14.x before 2.14.4, 2.15.x before 2.15.2, 2.16.x before 2.16.4,
    and 2.17.x before 2.17.1, remote code execution can occur. With a crafted .gitmodules
    file, a malicious project can execute an arbitrary script on a machine that runs "git
    clone --recurse-submodules" because submodule "names" are obtained from this file, and
    then appended to $GIT_DIR/modules, leading to directory traversal with "../" in a name.
    Finally, post-checkout hooks from a submodule are executed, bypassing the intended design
    in which hooks are not obtained from a remote server.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while enumerating attributes during SVG
    animations with clip paths. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and
    Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while adjusting layout during SVG animations with
    text paths. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array
    without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could
    lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    Crafted message headers can cause a Thunderbird process to hang on receiving the message.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8 and Thunderbird < 52.8.

    Plaintext of decrypted emails can leak through the src attribute of remote images, or
    links. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8 and Thunderbird < 52.8.

    Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by
    manipulating the "baseURI" property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious
    site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or
    embarrassing images. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR <
    52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    It is possible to spoof the filename of an attachment and display an arbitrary attachment
    name. This could lead to a user opening a remote attachment which is a different file type
    than expected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8 and Thunderbird < 52.8.

    A buffer overflow was found during UTF8 to Unicode string conversion within JavaScript
    with extremely large amounts of data. This vulnerability requires the use of a malicious
    or vulnerable legacy extension in order to occur. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
    ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    Mozilla developers backported selected changes in the Skia library. These changes correct
    memory corruption issues including invalid buffer reads and writes during graphic
    operations. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and
    Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    Using remote content in encrypted messages can lead to the disclosure of plaintext. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8 and Thunderbird < 52.8.

    Plaintext of decrypted emails can leak through by user submitting an embedded form. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8 and Thunderbird < 52.8.

    procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation in top. If a
    user runs top with HOME unset in an attacker-controlled directory, the attacker could
    achieve privilege escalation by exploiting one of several vulnerabilities in the
    config_file() function.

    procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a denial of service in ps via mmap buffer
    overflow. Inbuilt protection in ps maps a guard page at the end of the overflowed buffer,
    ensuring that the impact of this flaw is limited to a crash (temporary denial of service).

    procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to multiple integer overflows leading to a
    heap corruption in file2strvec function. This allows a privilege escalation for a local
    attacker who can create entries in procfs by starting processes, which could result in
    crashes or arbitrary code execution in proc utilities run by other users.

    procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow in pgrep. This
    vulnerability is mitigated by FORTIFY, as it involves strncat() to a stack-allocated
    string. When pgrep is compiled with FORTIFY (as on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora),
    the impact is limited to a crash.

    procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to an incorrect integer size in proc/alloc.*
    leading to truncation/integer overflow issues. This flaw is related to CVE-2018-1124.

    A statement in the System Programming Guide of the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures
    Software Developer's Manual (SDM) was mishandled in the development of some or all
    operating-system kernels, resulting in unexpected behavior for #DB exceptions that are
    deferred by MOV SS or POP SS, as demonstrated by (for example) privilege escalation in
    Windows, macOS, some Xen configurations, or FreeBSD, or a Linux kernel crash. The MOV to
    SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and
    single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction
    (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed
    by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not
    inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If
    the instruction following the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction is an instruction like
    SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control to the operating system at CPL < 3,
    the debug exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL < 3 is complete. OS kernels may
    not expect this order of events and may therefore experience unexpected behavior when it
    occurs.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (out-of-bounds zero write and hypervisor crash) via unexpected INT 80
    processing, because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5754.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x allowing x86 HVM guest OS users (in certain
    configurations) to read arbitrary dom0 files via QMP live insertion of a CDROM, in
    conjunction with specifying the target file as the backing file of a snapshot.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (host OS infinite loop) in situations where a QEMU device model attempts
    to make invalid transitions between states of a request.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (unexpectedly high interrupt number, array overrun, and hypervisor
    crash) or possibly gain hypervisor privileges by setting up an HPET timer to deliver
    interrupts in IO-APIC mode, aka vHPET interrupt injection.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while enumerating attributes during SVG
    animations with clip paths. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and
    Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while adjusting layout during SVG animations with
    text paths. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    Same-origin protections for the PDF viewer can be bypassed, allowing a malicious site to
    intercept messages meant for the viewer. This could allow the site to retrieve PDF files
    restricted to viewing by an authenticated user on a third-party website. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.8 and Firefox < 60.

    The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, allowing
    malicious JavaScript to be injected through a crafted PDF file. This JavaScript can then
    be run with the permissions of the PDF viewer by its worker. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 52.8 and Firefox < 60.

    An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array
    without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could
    lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by
    manipulating the "baseURI" property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious
    site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or
    embarrassing images. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR <
    52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    A buffer overflow was found during UTF8 to Unicode string conversion within JavaScript
    with extremely large amounts of data. This vulnerability requires the use of a malicious
    or vulnerable legacy extension in order to occur. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
    ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    Mozilla developers backported selected changes in the Skia library. These changes correct
    memory corruption issues including invalid buffer reads and writes during graphic
    operations. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and
    Firefox ESR < 52.8.

    sot/source/sdstor/stgstrms.cxx in LibreOffice before 5.4.5.1 and 6.x before 6.0.1.1 uses
    an incorrect integer data type in the StgSmallStrm class, which allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (use-after-free with write access) or possibly have unspecified
    other impact via a crafted document that uses the structured storage ole2 wrapper file
    format.

    The SwCTBWrapper::Read function in sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8toolbar.cxx in LibreOffice
    before 5.4.6.1 and 6.x before 6.0.2.1 does not validate a customizations index, which
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow with
    write access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted document that
    contains a certain Microsoft Word record.

    An issue was discovered in Teluu pjproject (pjlib and pjlib-util) in PJSIP before 2.7.1.
    Parsing the numeric header fields in a SIP message (like cseq, ttl, port, etc.) all had
    the potential to overflow, either causing unintended values to be captured or, if the
    values were subsequently converted back to strings, a buffer overrun. This will lead to a
    potential exploit using carefully crafted invalid values.

    An issue was discovered in Teluu pjproject (pjlib and pjlib-util) in PJSIP before 2.7.1.
    The ioqueue component may issue a double key unregistration after an attacker initiates a
    socket connection with specific settings and sequences. Such double key unregistration
    will trigger an integer overflow, which may cause ioqueue backends to reject future key
    registrations.

    Teluu PJSIP version 2.7.1 and earlier contains a Integer Overflow vulnerability in pjmedia
    SDP parsing that can result in Crash. This attack appear to be exploitable via Sending a
    specially crafted message. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 2.7.2.

  description: |
    In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap,
    if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup
    the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is
    not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it
    to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to
    'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL
    byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite
    unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In
    the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no
    effect at all.

    In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, the expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$'
    to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the
    filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are
    externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

    In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session
    data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence
    their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP_SESSION" variable
    name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also
    used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.

    A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version
    2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP
    header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in
    non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common
    server usage.

    A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to
    version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in shared
    memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache.
    The vulnerability is considered as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used,
    mod_cache_disk is not concerned by this vulnerability.

    In Apache httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29, when generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge,
    the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random
    seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP
    requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.

    When using incomplete escape codes, Irssi before 1.0.6 may access data beyond the end of
    the string.

    When the channel topic is set without specifying a sender, Irssi before 1.0.6 may
    dereference a NULL pointer.

    When using an incomplete variable argument, Irssi before 1.0.6 may access data beyond the
    end of the string.

    In Irssi before 1.0.6, a calculation error in the completion code could cause a heap
    buffer overflow when completing certain strings.

    An issue was discovered in Irssi before 1.0.7 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1. A NULL pointer
    dereference occurs for an "empty" nick.

    An issue was discovered in Irssi before 1.0.7 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1. Certain nick names
    could result in out-of-bounds access when printing theme strings.

    An issue was discovered in Irssi before 1.0.7 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1. When the number of
    windows exceeds the available space, a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference would
    occur.

    An issue was discovered in Irssi before 1.0.7 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1. There is a
    use-after-free when SASL messages are received in an unexpected order.

    An issue was discovered in Irssi before 1.0.7 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1. There is a
    use-after-free when a server is disconnected during netsplits. NOTE: this issue exists
    because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7191.

    An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before
    1.8.19. The django.utils.html.urlize() function was extremely slow to evaluate certain
    inputs due to catastrophic backtracking vulnerabilities in two regular expressions (only
    one regular expression for Django 1.8.x). The urlize() function is used to implement the
    urlize and urlizetrunc template filters, which were thus vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before
    1.8.19. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the
    html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a
    catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words()
    methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template
    filters, which were thus vulnerable.

  description: |
    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    52.7, Firefox ESR < 52.7, and Firefox < 59.

    A buffer overflow can occur when manipulating the SVG "animatedPathSegList" through
    script. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 52.7, Firefox ESR < 52.7, and Firefox < 59.

    A lack of parameter validation on IPC messages results in a potential out-of-bounds write
    through malformed IPC messages. This can potentially allow for sandbox escape through
    memory corruption in the parent process. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.7,
    Firefox ESR < 52.7, and Firefox < 59.

    An integer overflow can occur during conversion of text to some Unicode character sets due
    to an unchecked length parameter. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and
    Thunderbird < 52.7.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox ESR 52.6. These bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to
    run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Thunderbird < 52.7.

    An out of bounds memory write while processing Vorbis audio data was reported through the
    Pwn2Own contest. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 59.0.1, Firefox ESR < 52.7.2, and
    Thunderbird < 52.7.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    52.7, Firefox ESR < 52.7, and Firefox < 59.

    A buffer overflow can occur when manipulating the SVG "animatedPathSegList" through
    script. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 52.7, Firefox ESR < 52.7, and Firefox < 59.

    A lack of parameter validation on IPC messages results in a potential out-of-bounds write
    through malformed IPC messages. This can potentially allow for sandbox escape through
    memory corruption in the parent process. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.7,
    Firefox ESR < 52.7, and Firefox < 59.

    When packets with a mismatched RTP payload type are sent in WebRTC connections, in some
    circumstances a potentially exploitable crash is triggered. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.

    Under certain circumstances the "fetch()" API can return transient local copies of
    resources that were sent with a "no-store" or "no-cache" cache header instead of
    downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored,
    locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile
    while browsing. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Firefox < 59.

    An integer overflow can occur during conversion of text to some Unicode character sets due
    to an unchecked length parameter. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and
    Thunderbird < 52.7.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox ESR 52.6. These bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to
    run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Thunderbird < 52.7.

    In ARM mbed TLS before 2.7.0, there is a bounds-check bypass through an integer overflow
    in PSK identity parsing in the ssl_parse_client_psk_identity() function in
    library/ssl_srv.c.

    ARM mbed TLS before 1.3.22, before 2.1.10, and before 2.7.0 allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) via a crafted
    certificate chain that is mishandled during RSASSA-PSS signature verification within a TLS
    or DTLS session.

    ARM mbed TLS before 1.3.22, before 2.1.10, and before 2.7.0, when the truncated HMAC
    extension and CBC are used, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
    denial of service (heap corruption) via a crafted application packet within a TLS or DTLS
    session.

    All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a denial of service attack when
    the RPC spoolss service is configured to be run as an external daemon. Missing input
    sanitization checks on some of the input parameters to spoolss RPC calls could cause the
    print spooler service to crash.

    On a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards incorrectly
    validates permissions to modify passwords over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change
    any other users' passwords, including administrative users and privileged service accounts
    (eg Domain Controllers).

    A specially crafted email delivered over SMTP and passed on to Dovecot by MTA can trigger
    an out of bounds read resulting in potential sensitive information disclosure and denial
    of service. In order to trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially
    crafted email message to the server.

    A denial of service flaw was found in dovecot before 2.2.34. An attacker able to generate
    random SNI server names could exploit TLS SNI configuration lookups, leading to excessive
    memory usage and the process to restart.

    A flaw was found in dovecot 2.0 up to 2.2.33 and 2.3.0. An abort of SASL authentication
    results in a memory leak in dovecot's auth client used by login processes. The leak has
    impact in high performance configuration where same login processes are reused and can
    cause the process to crash due to memory exhaustion.

  description: |
    The SimpleSAML_Auth_TimeLimitedToken class in SimpleSAMLphp 1.14.14 and earlier allows
    attackers with access to a secret token to extend its validity period by manipulating the
    prepended time offset.

    The multiauth module in SimpleSAMLphp 1.14.13 and earlier allows remote attackers to
    bypass authentication context restrictions and use an authentication source defined in
    config/authsources.php via vectors related to improper validation of user input.

    SimpleSAMLphp 1.7.0 through 1.14.10 might allow attackers to obtain sensitive information,
    gain unauthorized access, or have unspecified other impacts by leveraging incorrect
    persistent NameID generation when an Identity Provider (IdP) is misconfigured.

    The InfoCard module 1.0 for SimpleSAMLphp allows attackers to spoof XML messages by
    leveraging an incorrect check of return values in signature validation utilities.

    The consentAdmin module in SimpleSAMLphp through 1.14.15 is vulnerable to a Cross-Site
    Scripting attack, allowing an attacker to craft links that could execute arbitrary
    JavaScript code on the victim's web browser.

    A signature-validation bypass issue was discovered in SimpleSAMLphp through 1.14.16. A
    SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider using SAML 1.1 will regard as valid any unsigned SAML
    response containing more than one signed assertion, provided that the signature of at
    least one of the assertions is valid. Attributes contained in all the assertions received
    will be merged and the entityID of the first assertion received will be used, allowing an
    attacker to impersonate any user of any IdP given an assertion signed by the targeted IdP.

    The SAML2 library before 1.10.4, 2.x before 2.3.5, and 3.x before 3.1.1 in SimpleSAMLphp
    has a Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability for fraction-of-seconds data in a
    timestamp.

    The sqlauth module in SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.2 relies on the MySQL utf8 charset, which
    truncates queries upon encountering four-byte characters. There might be a scenario in
    which this allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

    The XmlSecLibs library as used in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.3
    incorrectly verifies signatures on SAML assertions, allowing a remote attacker to
    construct a crafted SAML assertion on behalf of an Identity Provider that would pass as
    cryptographically valid, thereby allowing them to impersonate a user from that Identity
    Provider, aka a key confusion issue.

    When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull index files from a
    master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However, Solr before 5.5.4
    and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a
    special request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server
    process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/or
    authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users would gain direct
    HTTP access.

    Remote code execution occurs in Apache Solr before 7.1 with Apache Lucene before 7.1 by
    exploiting XXE in conjunction with use of a Config API add-listener command to reach the
    RunExecutableListener class. Elasticsearch, although it uses Lucene, is NOT vulnerable to
    this. Note that the XML external entity expansion vulnerability occurs in the XML Query
    Parser which is available, by default, for any query request with parameters
    deftype=xmlparser and can be exploited to upload malicious data to the /upload request
    handler or as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper in order to read arbitrary local files from the
    Solr server. Note also that the second vulnerability relates to remote code execution
    using the RunExecutableListener available on all affected versions of Solr.

    Drupal 8.4.x versions before 8.4.5 and Drupal 7.x versions before 7.57 has a
    Drupal.checkPlain() JavaScript function which is used to escape potentially dangerous text
    before outputting it to HTML (as JavaScript output does not typically go through Twig
    autoescaping). This function does not correctly handle all methods of injecting malicious
    HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability under certain circumstances. The PHP
    functions which Drupal provides for HTML escaping are not affected.

    Drupal core 7.x versions before 7.57 when using Drupal's private file system, Drupal will
    check to make sure a user has access to a file before allowing the user to view or
    download it. This check fails under certain conditions in which one module is trying to
    grant access to the file and another is trying to deny it, leading to an access bypass
    vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for unusual
    site configurations.

    A jQuery cross site scripting vulnerability is present when making Ajax requests to
    untrusted domains. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it requires
    contributed or custom modules in order to exploit. For Drupal 8, this vulnerability was
    already fixed in Drupal 8.4.0 in the Drupal core upgrade to jQuery 3. For Drupal 7, it is
    fixed in the current release (Drupal 7.57) for jQuery 1.4.4 (the version that ships with
    Drupal 7 core) as well as for other newer versions of jQuery that might be used on the
    site, for example using the jQuery Update module.

    Drupal core 7.x versions before 7.57 has an external link injection vulnerability when the
    language switcher block is used. A similar vulnerability exists in various custom and
    contributed modules. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to trick users into
    unwillingly navigating to an external site.

    The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) prior to version 1.2.3 can double-free memory when processing
    certain forms of UPDATE message, containing cluster-list and/or unknown attributes. A
    successful attack could cause a denial of service or potentially allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code.

    The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) prior to version 1.2.3 can overrun internal BGP
    code-to-string conversion tables used for debug by 1 pointer value, based on input.

    The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) prior to version 1.2.3 has a bug in its parsing of
    "Capabilities" in BGP OPEN messages, in the bgp_packet.c:bgp_capability_msg_parse
    function. The parser can enter an infinite loop on invalid capabilities if a
    Multi-Protocol capability does not have a recognized AFI/SAFI, causing a denial of
    service.

    FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.10 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows unauthenticated
    remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization
    flaw. This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue
    method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the Spring
    libraries are available in the classpath.

    The vorbis_analysis_wrote function in lib/block.c in Xiph.Org libvorbis 1.3.5 allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (OOM) via a crafted wav file.

    Xiph.Org libvorbis 1.3.5 allows Remote Code Execution upon freeing uninitialized memory in
    the function vorbis_analysis_headerout() in info.c when vi->channels<=0, a similar issue
    to Mozilla bug 550184.

    In Xiph.Org libvorbis 1.3.5, an out-of-bounds array read vulnerability exists in the
    function mapping0_forward() in mapping0.c, which may lead to DoS when operating on a
    crafted audio file with vorbis_analysis().

    example, an av://lavfi:ladspa=file= URL signifies that the product should call dlopen on a
    shared object file located at an arbitrary local pathname. The issue exists because the
    product does not consider that youtube-dl can provide a potentially unsafe URL.

  description: |
    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 57 and Firefox ESR 52.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.3 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.11, the IxVeriWave file parser could crash.
    This was addressed in wiretap/vwr.c by correcting the signature timestamp bounds checks.

    In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.3 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.11, the WCP dissector could crash. This was
    addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wcp.c by validating the available buffer length.

    In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.3 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.11, the JSON, XML, NTP, XMPP, and GDB
    dissectors could crash. This was addressed in epan/tvbparse.c by limiting the recursion

    In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a heap-based buffer overflow in the t2p_write_pdf function in
    tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow could lead to different damages. For example, a
    crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in
    TIFFClose or t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image, or a double free in
    t2p_free. Given these possibilities, it probably could cause arbitrary code execution.

    There is a heap based buffer overflow in tools/tiff2pdf.c of LibTIFF 4.0.8 via a
    PlanarConfig=Contig image, which causes a more than one hundred bytes out-of-bounds write
    (related to the ZIPDecode function in tif_zip.c). A crafted input may lead to a remote
    denial of service attack or an arbitrary code execution attack.

    The TIFFReadDirEntryArray function in tif_read.c in LibTIFF 4.0.8 mishandles memory
    allocation for short files, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (allocation failure and application crash) in the TIFFFetchStripThing function in
    tif_dirread.c during a tiff2pdf invocation.

    There is a reachable assertion abort in the function TIFFWriteDirectorySec() in LibTIFF
    4.0.8, related to tif_dirwrite.c and a SubIFD tag. A crafted input will lead to a remote
    denial of service attack.

    There is a reachable assertion abort in the function TIFFWriteDirectoryTagSubifd() in
    LibTIFF 4.0.8, related to tif_dirwrite.c and a SubIFD tag. A crafted input will lead to a
    remote denial of service attack.

    In LibTIFF 4.0.9, there is a Null-Pointer Dereference in the tif_print.c
    TIFFPrintDirectory function, as demonstrated by a tiffinfo crash.

    libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to third parties.
    When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of
    headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a
    30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:`
    response header value. Sending the same set of headers to subsequest hosts is in
    particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as
    this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others
    to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 57 and Firefox ESR 52.5. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebRTC connections when interacting with
    the DTMF timers. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 52.6 and Firefox < 58.

    An integer overflow vulnerability in the Skia library when allocating memory for edge
    builders on some systems with at least 8 GB of RAM. This results in the use of
    uninitialized memory, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while editing events in form elements on a page,
    resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    52.6 and Thunderbird < 52.6.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during XSL transformations when the source
    document for the transformation is manipulated by script content during the
    transformation. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when form input elements, focus, and selections
    are manipulated by script content. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the widget listener is holding strong
    references to browser objects that have previously been freed, resulting in a potentially
    exploitable crash when these references are used. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating HTML media elements with media
    streams, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during mouse event handling due to issues with
    multiprocess support. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during font face manipulation when a font face is
    freed while still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is
    possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue
    could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to
    believe they are on a different site than the one loaded. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 52.6, Firefox ESR < 52.6, and Firefox < 58.

    WordPress before 4.8.3 is affected by an issue where $wpdb->prepare() can create
    unexpected and unsafe queries leading to potential SQL injection (SQLi) in plugins and
    themes, as demonstrated by a "double prepare" approach, a different vulnerability than
    CVE-2017-14723.

    wp-admin/user-new.php in WordPress before 4.9.1 sets the newbloguser key to a string that
    can be directly derived from the user ID, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
    access restrictions by entering this string.

    wp-includes/functions.php in WordPress before 4.9.1 does not require the unfiltered_html
    capability for upload of .js files, which might allow remote attackers to conduct XSS
    attacks via a crafted file.

    wp-includes/general-template.php in WordPress before 4.9.1 does not properly restrict the
    lang attribute of an HTML element, which might allow attackers to conduct XSS attacks via
    the language setting of a site.

    wp-includes/feed.php in WordPress before 4.9.1 does not properly restrict enclosures in
    RSS and Atom fields, which might allow attackers to conduct XSS attacks via a crafted URL.

    In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM
    sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could
    lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a
    negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission.

    In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, an error in the date
    extension's timelib_meridian parsing code could be used by attackers able to supply date
    strings to leak information from the interpreter, related to ext/date/lib/parse_date.c
    out-of-bounds reads affecting the php_parse_date function. NOTE: the correct fix is in the
    e8b7698f5ee757ce2c8bd10a192a491a498f891c commit, not the bd77ac90d3bdf31ce2a5251ad92e9e75
    gist.

    In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, a stack-based buffer
    overflow in the zend_ini_do_op() function in Zend/zend_ini_parser.c could cause a denial
    of service or potentially allow executing code. NOTE: this is only relevant for PHP
    applications that accept untrusted input (instead of the system's php.ini file) for the
    parse_ini_string or parse_ini_file function, e.g., a web application for syntax validation
    of php.ini directives.

    ext/standard/var_unserializer.re in PHP 7.0.x through 7.0.22 and 7.1.x through 7.1.8 is
    prone to a heap use after free while unserializing untrusted data, related to improper use
    of the hash API for key deletion in a situation with an invalid array size. Exploitation
    of this issue can have an unspecified impact on the integrity of PHP.

    The finish_nested_data function in ext/standard/var_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.6.31,
    7.0.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7 is prone to a buffer over-read while
    unserializing untrusted data. Exploitation of this issue can have an unspecified impact on
    the integrity of PHP.

    ext/standard/var_unserializer.re in PHP 7.0.x before 7.0.21 and 7.1.x before 7.1.7 is
    prone to a heap use after free while unserializing untrusted data, related to the
    zval_get_type function in Zend/zend_types.h. Exploitation of this issue can have an
    unspecified impact on the integrity of PHP.

    In PHP before 5.6.32, 7.x before 7.0.25, and 7.1.x before 7.1.11, an error in the date
    extension's timelib_meridian handling of 'front of' and 'back of' directives could be used
    by attackers able to supply date strings to leak information from the interpreter, related
    to ext/date/lib/parse_date.c out-of-bounds reads affecting the php_parse_date function.
    NOTE: this is a different issue than CVE-2017-11145.

    gd_gif_in.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd), as used in PHP before 5.6.33, 7.0.x
    before 7.0.27, 7.1.x before 7.1.13, and 7.2.x before 7.2.1, has an integer signedness
    error that leads to an infinite loop via a crafted GIF file, as demonstrated by a call to
    the imagecreatefromgif or imagecreatefromstring PHP function. This is related to GetCode_
    and gdImageCreateFromGifCtx.

    An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.33, 7.0.x before 7.0.27, 7.1.x before 7.1.13,
    and 7.2.x before 7.2.1. There is Reflected XSS on the PHAR 404 error page via the URI of a
    request for a .phar file.

  description: |
    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 56 and Firefox ESR 52.4. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57,
    Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the
    "PressShell" object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash during these operations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57,
    Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    It is possible to spoof the sender's email address and display an arbitrary sender address
    to the email recipient. The real sender's address is not displayed if preceded by a null
    character in the display string. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.5.2.

    The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is
    a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57, Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    It is possible to execute JavaScript in the parsed RSS feed when RSS feed is viewed as a
    website, e.g. via "View -> Feed article -> Website" or in the standard format of "View ->
    Feed article -> default format". This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.5.2.

    Crafted CSS in an RSS feed can leak and reveal local path strings, which may contain user
    name. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.5.2.

    RSS fields can inject new lines into the created email structure, modifying the message
    body. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.5.2.

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the DestroyImage function in image.c in ImageMagick before
    7.0.6-6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.

    The ReadWPGImage function in coders/wpg.c in ImageMagick 7.0.7-9 does not properly
    validate the colormap index in a WPG palette, which allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (use of uninitialized data or invalid memory allocation) or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via a malformed WPG file.

    ImageMagick before 6.9.9-24 and 7.x before 7.0.7-12 has a use-after-free in
    Magick::Image::read in Magick++/lib/Image.cpp.

    ImageMagick before 7.0.7-12 has a coders/png.c Magick_png_read_raw_profile heap-based
    buffer over-read via a crafted file, related to ReadOneMNGImage.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.7-16 Q16 x86_64 2017-12-21, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in
    ReadOneMNGImage in coders/png.c, related to length calculation and caused by an off-by-one
    error.

    OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state" mechanism. The
    intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into
    the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake.
    This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(),
    SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if
    SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails
    then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If
    SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object
    then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly
    from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would
    have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after
    having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed
    in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.

    There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in
    exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that
    attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform
    and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because
    most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed
    offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
    However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024
    private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This
    only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell
    (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736,
    CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are
    affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not
    issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL
    1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the
    OpenSSL git repository.

  description: |
    When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to write persistent
    data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely. IndexedDB should not be available in
    Private Browsing mode and this stored data will persist across multiple private browsing
    mode sessions because it is not cleared when exiting. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 52.5.2 and Firefox < 57.0.1.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 56 and Firefox ESR 52.4. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57,
    Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the
    "PressShell" object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash during these operations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57,
    Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is
    a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57, Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-netbios.c by ensuring that write operations are
    bounded by the beginning of a buffer.

    In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.2 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.10, the IWARP_MPA dissector could crash. This
    was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-iwarp-mpa.c by validating a ULPDU length.

    In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.2 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.10, the CIP Safety dissector could crash.
    This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-cipsafety.c by validating the packet length.

    In OpenStack Nova through 14.0.9, 15.x through 15.0.7, and 16.x through 16.0.2, by
    rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent the Filter
    Scheduler bypassing imposed filters (for example, the ImagePropertiesFilter or the
    IsolatedHostsFilter). All setups using Nova Filter Scheduler are affected. Because of the
    regression described in Launchpad Bug #1732947, the preferred fix is a 14.x version after
    14.0.10, a 15.x version after 15.0.8, or a 16.x version after 16.0.3.

    The NTLM authentication feature in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 on 32-bit platforms
    allows attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and resultant buffer
    overflow, and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors
    involving long user and password fields.

    The FTP wildcard function in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 allows remote attackers to

    A parameter verification issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. The function
    `alloc_heap_pages` allows callers to specify the first NUMA node that should be used for
    allocations through the `memflags` parameter; the node is extracted using the
    `MEMF_get_node` macro. While the function checks to see if the special constant
    `NUMA_NO_NODE` is specified, it otherwise does not handle the case where `node >=
    MAX_NUMNODES`. This allows an out-of-bounds access to an internal array.

    A domain cleanup issue was discovered in the C xenstore daemon (aka cxenstored) in Xen
    through 4.9.x. When shutting down a VM with a stubdomain, a race in cxenstored may cause a
    double-free. The xenstored daemon may crash, resulting in a DoS of any parts of the system
    relying on it (including domain creation / destruction, ballooning, device changes, etc.).

    An issue was discovered in Xen 4.5.x through 4.9.x. The function `__gnttab_cache_flush`
    handles GNTTABOP_cache_flush grant table operations. It checks to see if the calling
    domain is the owner of the page that is to be operated on. If it is not, the owner's grant
    table is checked to see if a grant mapping to the calling domain exists for the page in
    question. However, the function does not check to see if the owning domain actually has a
    grant table or not. Some special domains, such as `DOMID_XEN`, `DOMID_IO` and `DOMID_COW`
    are created without grant tables. Hence, if __gnttab_cache_flush operates on a page owned
    by these special domains, it will attempt to dereference a NULL pointer in the domain
    struct.

    A grant unmapping issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. When removing or replacing a
    grant mapping, the x86 PV specific path needs to make sure page table entries remain in
    sync with other accounting done. Although the identity of the page frame was validated
    correctly, neither the presence of the mapping nor page writability were taken into
    account.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to execute
    arbitrary code on the host OS because of a race condition that can cause a stale TLB
    entry.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to obtain
    sensitive information from the host OS (or an arbitrary guest OS) because intercepted I/O
    operations can cause a write of data from uninitialized hypervisor stack memory.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing x86 guest OS users to cause a denial
    of service (hypervisor crash) or possibly gain privileges because MSI mapping was
    mishandled.

    An issue was discovered in Xen 4.5.x through 4.9.x allowing attackers (who control a stub
    domain kernel or tool stack) to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) because of a
    missing comparison (of range start to range end) within the DMOP map/unmap implementation.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (hypervisor crash) or possibly gain privileges because self-linear
    shadow mappings are mishandled for translated guests.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (memory leak) because reference counts are mishandled.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing x86 SVM PV guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (hypervisor crash) or gain privileges because IDT settings are
    mishandled during CPU hotplugging.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (unbounded recursion, stack consumption, and hypervisor crash) or
    possibly gain privileges via crafted page-table stacking.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made an implication that
    any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference. Other portions of code,
    however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being
    done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious guest
    administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting in host crash
    and a Denial of Service. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing HVM guest OS users to cause a denial
    of service (infinite loop and host OS hang) by leveraging the mishandling of Populate on
    Demand (PoD) errors.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x allowing HVM guest OS users to gain
    privileges on the host OS, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service (BUG
    and host OS crash) by leveraging the mishandling of Populate on Demand (PoD)
    Physical-to-Machine (P2M) errors.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x on the ARM platform allowing guest OS users
    to obtain sensitive information from DRAM after a reboot, because disjoint blocks, and
    physical addresses that do not start at zero, are mishandled.

    Double free vulnerability in FFmpeg 3.3.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service via a crafted AVI file.

    The read_header function in libavcodec/ffv1dec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.4 and earlier allows remote
    attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted MP4 file, which triggers an

    MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before 1.29.2 has XSS when the
    $wgShowExceptionDetails setting is false and the browser sends non-standard URL escaping.

    api.php in MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before 1.29.2 has a
    Reflected File Download vulnerability.

    MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before 1.29.2, when a private
    wiki is configured, provides different error messages for failed login attempts depending
    on whether the username exists, which allows remote attackers to enumerate account names
    and conduct brute-force attacks via a series of requests.

    The implementation of raw message parameter expansion in MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x
    before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before 1.29.2 allows HTML mangling attacks.

    MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before 1.29.2 allows remote
    attackers to inject > (greater than) characters via the id attribute of a headline.

    The language converter in MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before
    1.29.2 allows attackers to replace text inside tags via a rule definition followed by "a

    The language converter in MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before
    1.29.2 allows attribute injection attacks via glossary rules.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 56 and Firefox ESR 52.4. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57,
    Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when flushing and resizing layout because the
    "PressShell" object has been freed while still in use. This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash during these operations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57,
    Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    The Resource Timing API incorrectly revealed navigations in cross-origin iframes. This is
    a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft of URLs loaded by users.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57, Firefox ESR < 52.5, and Thunderbird < 52.5.

    Heap-based buffer overflow in the ReadSFWImage function in coders/sfw.c in ImageMagick
    7.0.6-8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
    possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-6 and GraphicsMagick 1.3.26, a heap-based buffer over-read was found
    in the function SFWScan in coders/sfw.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service via a crafted file.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-10, there is a heap-based buffer overflow in the TracePoint()
    function in MagickCore/draw.c.

    The WriteTHUMBNAILImage function in coders/thumbnail.c in ImageMagick through 7.0.6-10
    allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) by sending a crafted
    JPEG file.

    A heap-based buffer overflow in WritePCXImage in coders/pcx.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-8 Q16
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or code execution via a crafted file.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.7-4 Q16, an out of bounds read flaw related to ReadTIFFImage has been
    reported in coders/tiff.c. An attacker could possibly exploit this flaw to disclose
    potentially sensitive memory or cause an application crash.

    GetNextToken in MagickCore/token.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6 allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact via a crafted SVG document, a different vulnerability than
    CVE-2017-10928.

    A use-after-free in RenderFreetype in MagickCore/annotate.c in ImageMagick 7.0.7-4 Q16
    allows attackers to crash the application via a crafted font file, because the
    FT_Done_Glyph function (from FreeType 2) is called at an incorrect place in the
    ImageMagick code.

    ReadGIFImage in coders/gif.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 and GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 leaves the
    palette uninitialized when processing a GIF file that has neither a global nor local
    palette. If the affected product is used as a library loaded into a process that operates
    on interesting data, this data sometimes can be leaked via the uninitialized palette.

    Ruby before 2.4.2, 2.3.5, and 2.2.8 is vulnerable to a malicious format string which
    contains a precious specifier (*) with a huge minus value. Such situation can lead to a
    buffer overrun, resulting in a heap memory corruption or an information disclosure from
    the heap.

    RubyGems versions between 2.0.0 and 2.6.13 are vulnerable to a possible remote code
    execution vulnerability. YAML deserialization of gem specifications can bypass class white
    lists. Specially crafted serialized objects can possibly be used to escalate to remote
    code execution.

    The Basic authentication code in WEBrick library in Ruby before 2.2.8, 2.3.x before 2.3.5,
    and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 allows remote attackers to inject terminal emulator escape
    sequences into its log and possibly execute arbitrary commands via a crafted user name.

    The decode method in the OpenSSL::ASN1 module in Ruby before 2.2.8, 2.3.x before 2.3.5,
    and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (interpreter crash)
    via a crafted string.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.5-8 Q16, an assertion failure was found in the function
    ResetImageProfileIterator, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a
    crafted file.

    The ReadPESImage function in coders\pes.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 has an infinite loop
    vulnerability that can cause CPU exhaustion via a crafted PES file.

    The ReadTXTImage function in coders/txt.c in ImageMagick through 6.9.9-0 and 7.x through
    7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted
    file, because the end-of-file condition is not considered.

    When ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 processes a crafted file in convert, it can lead to a heap-based
    buffer over-read in the WriteUILImage() function in coders/uil.c.

    When ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 processes a crafted file in convert, it can lead to a heap-based
    buffer over-read in the WritePSImage() function in coders/ps.c.

    When ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 processes a crafted file in convert, it can lead to a Floating
    Point Exception (FPE) in the WritePALMImage() function in coders/palm.c, related to an
    incorrect bits-per-pixel calculation.

    When ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 processes a crafted file in convert, it can lead to a heap-based
    buffer over-read in the WriteCIPImage() function in coders/cip.c, related to the
    GetPixelLuma function in MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h.

    When ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 processes a crafted file in convert, it can lead to an address
    access exception in the WritePTIFImage() function in coders/tiff.c.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-1, a memory leak vulnerability was found in the function ReadWMFImage
    in coders/wmf.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service in CloneDrawInfo in
    draw.c.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-1, a use-after-free vulnerability was found in the function
    ReadWMFImage in coders/wmf.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-1, a memory exhaustion vulnerability was found in the function
    ReadPCXImage in coders/pcx.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-1, a missing NULL check vulnerability was found in the function
    ReadMATImage in coders/mat.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service
    (assertion failure) in DestroyImageInfo in image.c.

    ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 has a large loop vulnerability in the ReadPWPImage function in
    coders\pwp.c.

    ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 has an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in ReadOneMNGImage in
    coders/png.c.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-3, a missing NULL assignment was found in coders/png.c, leading to an
    invalid free in the function RelinquishMagickMemory in MagickCore/memory.c, which allows
    attackers to cause a denial of service.

    In ImageMagick before 6.9.9-0 and 7.x before 7.0.6-1, the ReadOneMNGImage function in
    coders/png.c has an out-of-bounds read with the MNG CLIP chunk.

    In ImageMagick before 6.9.9-1 and 7.x before 7.0.6-2, the ReadOnePNGImage function in
    coders/png.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application hang in
    LockSemaphoreInfo) via a PNG file with a width equal to MAGICK_WIDTH_LIMIT.

    In ImageMagick before 6.9.9-4 and 7.x before 7.0.6-4, a crafted file could trigger a
    memory leak in ReadOnePNGImage in coders/png.c.

    In ImageMagick before 6.9.9-0 and 7.x before 7.0.6-1, a crafted PNG file could trigger a
    crash because there was an insufficient check for short files.

    In ImageMagick before 6.9.7-6 and 7.x before 7.0.4-6, the ReadMATImage function in
    coders/mat.c uses uninitialized data, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
    sensitive information from process memory.

    In ImageMagick before 6.9.7-10, there is a crash (rather than a "width or height exceeds
    limit" error report) if the image dimensions are too large, as demonstrated by use of the
    mpc coder.

    In ImageMagick before 6.9.8-8 and 7.x before 7.0.5-9, the ReadJP2Image function in
    coders/jp2.c does not properly validate the channel geometry, leading to a crash.

    While parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, it is possible to do a

    bug has been present since 2006 and is present in all versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.2m
    and 1.1.0g.

    There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure in OpenSSL
    before 1.0.2m and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0g. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests
    that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to
    perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible
    (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a
    private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack
    would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An
    attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target
    private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared
    between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX
    extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

    Irssi before 1.0.5, when installing themes with unterminated colour formatting sequences,
    may access data beyond the end of the string.

    In Irssi before 1.0.5, certain incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages could cause a NULL
    pointer dereference. This is a separate, but similar, issue relative to CVE-2017-9468.

    In certain cases, Irssi before 1.0.5 may fail to verify that a Safe channel ID is long
    enough, causing reads beyond the end of the string.

    In Irssi before 1.0.5, overlong nicks or targets may result in a NULL pointer dereference

  description: |
    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in the Fetch API when the worker or the
    associated window are freed when still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird <
    52.4.

    During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer.
    This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can
    exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer.
    This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free
    when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and
    Thunderbird < 52.4.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 55 and Firefox ESR 52.3. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56,
    Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    File downloads encoded with "blob:" and "data:" URL elements bypassed normal file download
    checks though the Phishing and Malware Protection feature and its block lists of
    suspicious sites and files. This would allow malicious sites to lure users into
    downloading executables that would otherwise be detected as suspicious. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating arrays of Accessible Rich
    Internet Applications (ARIA) elements within containers through the DOM. This results in a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR <
    52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in design mode when image objects are resized if
    objects referenced during the resizing have been freed from memory. This results in a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR <
    52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    The content security policy (CSP) "sandbox" directive did not create a unique origin for
    the document, causing it to behave as if the "allow-same-origin" keyword were always
    specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe
    content. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird <
    52.4.

    A buffer overflow occurs when drawing and validating elements with the ANGLE graphics
    library, used for WebGL content. This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the
    library during checks and results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    The opj_pi_update_decode_poc function in pi.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google
    Chrome before 48.0.2564.109, miscalculates a certain layer index value, which allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted PDF
    document.

    pi.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.109, does not
    validate a certain precision value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted JPEG 2000 image in a
    PDF document, related to the opj_pi_next_rpcl, opj_pi_next_pcrl, and opj_pi_next_cprl
    functions.

    Integer overflow in the opj_tcd_get_decoded_tile_size function in tcd.c in OpenJPEG, as
    used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows and OS X and before
    53.0.2785.92 on Linux, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based
    buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data.

    Heap Buffer Overflow (WRITE of size 4) in function pnmtoimage of convert.c:1719 in
    OpenJPEG 2.1.2.

    A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the opj_t2_encode_packet function in
    lib/openjp2/t2.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds write, which
    may lead to remote denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.

    An invalid write access was discovered in bin/jp2/convert.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0, triggering
    a crash in the tgatoimage function. The vulnerability may lead to remote denial of service
    or possibly unspecified other impact.

    A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the pgxtoimage function in
    bin/jp2/convert.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds write,
    which may lead to remote denial of service or possibly remote code execution.

    A mishandled zero case was discovered in opj_j2k_set_cinema_parameters in
    lib/openjp2/j2k.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds write,
    which may lead to remote denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow affecting
    opj_write_bytes_LE in lib/openjp2/cio.c and opj_j2k_write_sot in lib/openjp2/j2k.c) or
    possibly remote code execution.

    The http.c:skip_short_body() function is called in some circumstances, such as when

    parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunk length
    is a non-negative number. The code then tries to skip the chunk in pieces of 512 bytes by
    using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk length to
    connect.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32 bits of the chunk
    length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length
    argument.

    The retr.c:fd_read_body() function is called when processing OK responses. When the

    An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number of bytes.
    When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass on that (non-existing)
    data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's
    deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the data to
    figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap based buffer that might not be
    zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after
    (or just crash) and then deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.

    During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer.
    This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can
    exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer.
    This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free
    when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and
    Thunderbird < 52.4.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress was susceptible to a Cross-Site Scripting attack in the
    link modal via a javascript: or data: URL.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress was vulnerable to a directory traversal attack during
    unzip operations in the ZipArchive and PclZip components.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress allowed a Cross-Site scripting attack in the template list
    view via a crafted template name.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress allowed Cross-Site scripting in the plugin editor via a
    crafted plugin name.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress allowed a Directory Traversal attack in the Customizer
    component via a crafted theme filename.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress mishandled % characters and additional placeholder values
    in $wpdb->prepare, and thus did not properly address the possibility of plugins and themes
    enabling SQL injection attacks.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress was susceptible to an open redirect attack in
    wp-admin/edit-tag-form.php and wp-admin/user-edit.php.

    Before version 4.8.2, WordPress was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack via
    shortcodes in the TinyMCE visual editor.

    WordPress 4.8.2 stores cleartext wp_signups.activation_key values (but stores the
    analogous wp_users.user_activation_key values as hashes), which might make it easier for
    remote attackers to hijack unactivated user accounts by leveraging database read access
    (such as access gained through an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability).

    In libavformat/rmdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in ivr_read_header() due to lack of an EOF
    (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted IVR file, which
    claims a large "len" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is
    provided, the first type==4 loop would consume huge CPU resources, since there is no EOF
    check inside the loop.

    In libavformat/mvdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in mv_read_header() due to lack of an EOF
    (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted MV file,
    which claims a large "nb_frames" field in the header but does not contain sufficient
    backing data, is provided, the loop over the frames would consume huge CPU and memory
    resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.

    In libavformat/rl2.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in rl2_read_header() due to lack of an EOF
    (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted RL2 file,
    which claims a large "frame_count" field in the header but does not contain sufficient
    backing data, is provided, the loops (for offset and size tables) would consume huge CPU
    and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside these loops.

    In FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in asf_read_marker() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check
    might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted ASF file, which claims a large
    "name_len" or "count" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is
    provided, the loops over the name and markers would consume huge CPU and memory resources,
    since there is no EOF check inside these loops.

    In FFmpeg 3.3.3, the read_data function in libavformat/hls.c does not restrict reload
    attempts for an insufficient list, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (infinite loop).

    In FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in cine_read_header() due to lack of an EOF check might cause huge
    CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted CINE file, which claims a large "duration"
    field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the
    image-offset parsing loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no
    EOF check inside the loop.

    In the mxf_read_primer_pack function in libavformat/mxfdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, an integer
    signedness error might occur when a crafted file, which claims a large "item_num" field
    such as 0xffffffff, is provided. As a result, the variable "item_num" turns negative,
    bypassing the check for a large value.

    In libavformat/mxfdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in mxf_read_index_entry_array() due to lack
    of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted MXF file,
    which claims a large "nb_index_entries" field in the header but does not contain
    sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop would consume huge CPU resources, since
    there is no EOF check inside the loop. Moreover, this big loop can be invoked multiple
    times if there is more than one applicable data segment in the crafted MXF file.

    In libavformat/nsvdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in nsv_parse_NSVf_header() due to lack of
    an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted NSV file,
    which claims a large "table_entries_used" field in the header but does not contain
    sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop over 'table_entries_used' would consume
    huge CPU resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.

    In libavformat/mov.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in read_tfra() due to lack of an EOF (End of
    File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted MOV file, which
    claims a large "item_count" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing
    data, is provided, the loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no
    EOF check inside the loop.

    In libavformat/asfdec_f.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in asf_build_simple_index() due to lack
    of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted ASF file,
    which claims a large "ict" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing
    data, is provided, the for loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there
    is no EOF check inside the loop.

    The av_color_primaries_name function in libavutil/pixdesc.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3 may return a
    NULL pointer depending on a value contained in a file, but callers do not anticipate this,
    as demonstrated by the avcodec_string function in libavcodec/utils.c, leading to a NULL
    pointer dereference. (It is also conceivable that there is security relevance for a NULL
    pointer dereference in av_color_primaries_name calls within the ffprobe command-line
    program.)

    The sdp_parse_fmtp_config_h264 function in libavformat/rtpdec_h264.c in FFmpeg before
    3.3.4 mishandles empty sprop-parameter-sets values, which allows remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service (heap buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
    crafted sdp file.

    In the PatternMatch function in fontfile/fontdir.c in libXfont through 1.5.2 and 2.x

    involving ? characters.

    GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using the .desktop
    file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop file's Name field ends in
    .pdf but this file's Exec field launches a malicious "sh -c" command. In other words,
    Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe
    .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly)
    mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission.
    The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a
    .desktop file, and then remember the user's answer in the metadata::trusted field.

  description: |
    When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very long file
    name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer
    boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length.
    This too large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to send more
    data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto() function will then read beyond
    the end of the heap based buffer. A malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable
    libcurl-using client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which
    protocols it allows redirects to) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote
    server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with --proto-redir and libcurl's with
    CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.

    curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range to have the
    tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the globbing function
    that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond
    the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is
    stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else
    instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be
    `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.

    libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. When libcurl connects
    to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the
    current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response
    containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl
    for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a
    directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl
    not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then
    later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or
    wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious
    server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it
    - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high
    chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered
    for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We
    are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit
    [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl
    version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not
    terminated properly with a final double quote.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in the Fetch API when the worker or the
    associated window are freed when still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird <
    52.4.

    During TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer.
    This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can
    exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer.
    This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free
    when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and
    Thunderbird < 52.4.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 55 and Firefox ESR 52.3. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56,
    Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    File downloads encoded with "blob:" and "data:" URL elements bypassed normal file download
    checks though the Phishing and Malware Protection feature and its block lists of
    suspicious sites and files. This would allow malicious sites to lure users into
    downloading executables that would otherwise be detected as suspicious. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating arrays of Accessible Rich
    Internet Applications (ARIA) elements within containers through the DOM. This results in a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR <
    52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in design mode when image objects are resized if
    objects referenced during the resizing have been freed from memory. This results in a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR <
    52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    The content security policy (CSP) "sandbox" directive did not create a unique origin for
    the document, causing it to behave as if the "allow-same-origin" keyword were always
    specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe
    content. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird <
    52.4.

    A buffer overflow occurs when drawing and validating elements with the ANGLE graphics
    library, used for WebGL content. This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the
    library during checks and results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

    or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PostScript document. This is
    related to a lack of an integer overflow check in base/gsalloc.c.

    psi/ztoken.c in Artifex Ghostscript 9.21 mishandles references to the scanner state
    structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash)
    or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PostScript document, related to an
    out-of-bounds read in the igc_reloc_struct_ptr function in psi/igc.c.

    It was found that samba before 4.4.16, 4.5.x before 4.5.14, and 4.6.x before 4.6.8 did not
    enforce "SMB signing" when certain configuration options were enabled. A remote attacker
    could launch a man-in-the-middle attack and retrieve information in plain-text.

    A flaw was found in the way samba client before samba 4.4.16, samba 4.5.14 and samba 4.6.8
    used encryption with the max protocol set as SMB3. The connection could lose the
    requirement for signing and encrypting to any DFS redirects, allowing an attacker to read
    or alter the contents of the connection via a man-in-the-middle attack.

    An information leak flaw was found in the way SMB1 protocol was implemented by Samba
    before 4.4.16, 4.5.x before 4.5.14, and 4.6.x before 4.6.8. A malicious client could use
    this flaw to dump server memory contents to a file on the samba share or to a shared
    printer, though the exact area of server memory cannot be controlled by the attacker.

    Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit
    directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain
    misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34
    and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when
    attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not
    always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration.
    Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function
    in server/core.c.

    tcpdump 4.9.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
    over-read and application crash) via crafted packet data. The crash occurs in the
    EXTRACT_16BITS function, called from the stp_print function for the Spanning Tree
    Protocol.

  description: |
    Xen through 4.8.x mishandles page transfer, which allows guest OS users to obtain
    privileged host OS access, aka XSA-217.

    The grant-table feature in Xen through 4.8.x provides false mapping information in certain
    cases of concurrent unmap calls, which allows backend attackers to obtain sensitive
    information or gain privileges, aka XSA-218 bug 1.

    The grant-table feature in Xen through 4.8.x has a race condition leading to a double
    free, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), or
    possibly obtain sensitive information or gain privileges, aka XSA-218 bug 2.

    The shadow-paging feature in Xen through 4.8.x mismanages page references and consequently
    introduces a race condition, which allows guest OS users to obtain Xen privileges, aka
    XSA-219.

    Xen through 4.8.x does not validate the port numbers of polled event channel ports, which
    allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS
    crash) or possibly obtain sensitive information, aka XSA-221.

    Xen through 4.8.x does not validate memory allocations during certain P2M operations,
    which allows guest OS users to obtain privileged host OS access, aka XSA-222.

    The grant-table feature in Xen through 4.8.x mishandles a GNTMAP_device_map and
    GNTMAP_host_map mapping, when followed by only a GNTMAP_host_map unmapping, which allows
    guest OS users to cause a denial of service (count mismanagement and memory corruption) or
    obtain privileged host OS access, aka XSA-224 bug 1.

    The grant-table feature in Xen through 4.8.x does not ensure sufficient type counts for a
    GNTMAP_device_map and GNTMAP_host_map mapping, which allows guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (count mismanagement and memory corruption) or obtain privileged host OS
    access, aka XSA-224 bug 2.

    The grant-table feature in Xen through 4.8.x mishandles MMIO region grant references,
    which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (loss of grant trackability), aka
    XSA-224 bug 3.

    Xen allows local OS guest users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly obtain
    sensitive information or gain privileges via vectors involving transitive grants.

    arch/x86/mm.c in Xen allows local PV guest OS users to gain host OS privileges via vectors
    related to map_grant_ref.

    Xen maintains the _GTF_{read,writ}ing bits as appropriate, to inform the guest that a
    grant is in use. A guest is expected not to modify the grant details while it is in use,
    whereas the guest is free to modify/reuse the grant entry when it is not in use. Under
    some circumstances, Xen will clear the status bits too early, incorrectly informing the
    guest that the grant is no longer in use. A guest may prematurely believe that a granted
    frame is safely private again, and reuse it in a way which contains sensitive information,
    while the domain on the far end of the grant is still using the grant. Xen 4.9, 4.8, 4.7,
    4.6, and 4.5 are affected.

    An issue was discovered in Xen 4.4.x through 4.9.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (prevent physical CPU usage) because of lock mishandling upon detection
    of an add-to-physmap error.

    Net::SMTP in Ruby before 2.4.0 is vulnerable to SMTP command injection via CRLF sequences
    in a RCPT TO or MAIL FROM command, as demonstrated by CRLF sequences immediately before
    and after a DATA substring.

    The openssl gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector (IV) in GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm)
    when the IV is set before the key, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers
    to bypass the encryption protection mechanism.

    RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to maliciously crafted gem
    specifications that include terminal escape characters. Printing the gem specification
    would execute terminal escape sequences.

    RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to maliciously crafted gem
    specifications to cause a denial of service attack against RubyGems clients who have
    issued a `query` command.

    RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier fails to validate specification names, allowing a
    maliciously crafted gem to potentially overwrite any file on the filesystem.

    RubyGems version 2.6.12 and earlier is vulnerable to a DNS hijacking vulnerability that
    allows a MITM attacker to force the RubyGems client to download and install gems from a
    server that the attacker controls.

    Ruby through 2.2.7, 2.3.x through 2.3.4, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 can expose arbitrary
    memory during a JSON.generate call. The issues lies in using strdup in
    ext/json/ext/generator/generator.c, which will stop after encountering a '\0' byte,
    returning a pointer to a string of length zero, which is not the length stored in
    space_len.

    In res/res_rtp_asterisk.c in Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x
    before 14.6.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5,
    unauthorized data disclosure (media takeover in the RTP stack) is possible with careful
    timing by an attacker. The "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP
    stack that learns the source address of media for a session and drops any packets that do
    not originate from the expected address. This option is enabled by default in Asterisk 11
    and above. The "nat" and "rtp_symmetric" options (for chan_sip and chan_pjsip,
    respectively) enable symmetric RTP support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address
    of incoming media as the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by
    default, but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT. A change was made to the
    strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate late media when a reinvite occurs.
    When combined with the symmetric RTP support, this introduced an avenue where media could
    be hijacked. Instead of only learning a new address when expected, the new code allowed a
    new source address to be learned at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was received, the
    strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide media, and (with symmetric RTP
    enabled) outgoing traffic would be sent to this new address, allowing the media to be
    hijacked. Provided the attacker continued to send traffic, they would continue to receive
    traffic as well.

    In Asterisk 11.x before 11.25.2, 13.x before 13.17.1, and 14.x before 14.6.1 and Certified
    Asterisk 11.x before 11.6-cert17 and 13.x before 13.13-cert5, unauthorized command
    execution is possible. The app_minivm module has an "externnotify" program configuration
    option that is executed by the MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the
    caller-id name and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for
    interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number can come from an
    untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows an arbitrary shell command
    injection.

    A remote code execution vulnerability in libxml2 could enable an attacker using a
    specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of an unprivileged
    process. This issue is rated as High due to the possibility of remote code execution in an
    application that uses this library. Product: Android. Versions: 4.4.4, 5.0.2, 5.1.1, 6.0,
    6.0.1, 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2. Android ID: A-37104170.

    A flaw in libxml2 allows remote XML entity inclusion with default parser flags (i.e., when
    the caller did not request entity substitution, DTD validation, external DTD subset
    loading, or default DTD attributes). Depending on the context, this may expose a
    higher-risk attack surface in libxml2 not usually reachable with default parser flags, and
    expose content from local files, HTTP, or FTP servers (which might be otherwise
    unreachable).

    Buffer overflow in libxml2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging
    an incorrect limit for port values when handling redirects.

    A buffer overflow was discovered in libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801. The function
    xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element content
    definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. The variable len is assigned
    strlen(buf). If the content->type is XML_ELEMENT_CONTENT_ELEMENT, then (i) the
    content->prefix is appended to buf (if it actually fits) whereupon (ii) content->name is
    written to the buffer. However, the check for whether the content->name actually fits also
    uses 'len' rather than the updated buffer length strlen(buf). This allows us to write
    about "size" many bytes beyond the allocated memory. This vulnerability causes programs
    that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.

    libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The
    function xmlSnprintfElementContent in valid.c is supposed to recursively dump the element
    content definition into a char buffer 'buf' of size 'size'. At the end of the routine, the
    function may strcat two more characters without checking whether the current strlen(buf) +
    2 < size. This vulnerability causes programs that use libxml2, such as PHP, to crash.

    libxml2 20904-GITv2.9.4-16-g0741801 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer over-read in the
    xmlDictComputeFastKey function in dict.c. This vulnerability causes programs that use
    libxml2, such as PHP, to crash. This vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
    libxml2 Bug 759398.

  description: |
    An out-of-bounds read occurs when applying style rules to pseudo-elements, such as
    ::first-line, using cached style data. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3,
    Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 54, Firefox ESR 52.2, and Thunderbird 52.2.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when reading an image observer during frame
    reconstruction after the observer has been freed. This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and
    Firefox < 55.

    A buffer overflow can occur when manipulating Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)
    attributes within the DOM. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    A buffer overflow can occur when the image renderer attempts to paint non-displayable SVG
    elements. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    Same-origin policy protections can be bypassed on pages with embedded iframes during page
    reloads, allowing the iframes to access content on the top level page, leading to
    information disclosure. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3,
    and Firefox < 55.

    On pages containing an iframe, the "data:" protocol can be used to create a modal alert
    that will render over arbitrary domains following page navigation, spoofing of the origin
    of the modal alert from the iframe content. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3,
    Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    A buffer overflow will occur when viewing a certificate in the certificate manager if the
    certificate has an extremely long object identifier (OID). This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and
    Firefox < 55.

    The Developer Tools feature suffers from a XUL injection vulnerability due to improper
    sanitization of the web page source code. In the worst case, this could allow arbitrary
    code execution when opening a malicious page with the style editor tool. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.3 and Firefox < 55.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in WebSockets when the object holding the
    connection is freed before the disconnection operation is finished. This results in an
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and
    Firefox < 55.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while re-computing layout for a "marquee" element
    during window resizing where the updated style object is freed while still in use. This
    results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3,
    Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when manipulating the DOM during the resize event
    of an image element. If these elements have been freed due to a lack of strong references,
    a potentially exploitable crash may occur when the freed elements are accessed. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    When a page's content security policy (CSP) header contains a "sandbox" directive, other
    directives are ignored. This results in the incorrect enforcement of CSP. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    A mechanism that uses AppCache to hijack a URL in a domain using fallback by serving the
    files from a sub-path on the domain. This has been addressed by requiring fallback files
    be inside the manifest directory. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox
    ESR < 52.3, and Firefox < 55.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when an editor DOM node is deleted prematurely
    during tree traversal while still bound to the document. This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.3, Firefox ESR < 52.3, and
    Firefox < 55.

    The qemu-nbd server in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator), when built with the Network Block Device
    (NBD) Server support, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation
    fault and server crash) by leveraging failure to ensure that all initialization occurs
    before talking to a client in the nbd_negotiate function.

    Stack-based buffer overflow in hw/usb/redirect.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local
    guest OS users to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) via vectors related to
    logging debug messages.

    The address_space_write_continue function in exec.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows
    local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access and
    guest instance crash) by leveraging use of qemu_map_ram_ptr to access guest ram block
    area.

    The dhcp_decode function in slirp/bootp.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest
    OS users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and QEMU process crash) via a
    crafted DHCP options string.

    An issue was discovered in Varnish HTTP Cache 4.0.1 through 4.0.4, 4.1.0 through 4.1.7,
    5.0.0, and 5.1.0 through 5.1.2. A wrong if statement in the varnishd source code means
    that particular invalid requests from the client can trigger an assert, related to an
    Integer Overflow. This causes the varnishd worker process to abort and restart, losing the
    cached contents in the process. An attacker can therefore crash the varnishd worker
    process on demand and effectively keep it from serving content - a Denial-of-Service
    attack. The specific source-code filename containing the incorrect statement varies across
    releases.

    QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) before 2.9.0, when built with the USB OHCI Emulation support,
    allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by leveraging an
    incorrect return value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-6505.

    Memory leak in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator), when built with IDE AHCI Emulation support,
    allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
    by repeatedly hot-unplugging the AHCI device.

    guest OS) kernel memory by leveraging the copying of uninitialized padding fields in Xen
    block-interface response structures, aka XSA-216.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.5-5, a memory leak was found in the function ReadPDBImage in
    coders/pdb.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.5-5, a memory leak was found in the function ReadPSDChannel in
    coders/psd.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.5-7 Q16, an assertion failure was found in the function
    LockSemaphoreInfo, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.6-0, a heap-based buffer over-read in the GetNextToken function in
    token.c allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or
    possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SVG document that is mishandled in
    the GetUserSpaceCoordinateValue function in coders/svg.c.

    The ReadMATImage function in coders\mat.c in ImageMagick 7.0.5-6 has a memory leak
    vulnerability that can cause memory exhaustion via a crafted MAT file, related to
    incorrect ordering of a SetImageExtent call.

    The ReadTGAImage function in coders\tga.c in ImageMagick 7.0.5-6 has a memory leak
    vulnerability that can cause memory exhaustion via invalid colors data in the header of a
    TGA or VST file.

    The ReadDPXImage function in coders\dpx.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-0 has a large loop
    vulnerability that can cause CPU exhaustion via a crafted DPX file, related to lack of an
    EOF check.

    The ReadRLEImage function in coders\rle.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 has a large loop
    vulnerability via a crafted rle file that triggers a huge number_pixels value.

    coders/mpc.c in ImageMagick before 7.0.6-1 does not enable seekable streams and thus
    cannot validate blob sizes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an image received from
    stdin.

    The ReadJPEGImage function in coders/jpeg.c in ImageMagick before 7.0.6-1 allows remote
    attackers to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized memory locations via a
    crafted file.

    The ReadSCREENSHOTImage function in coders/screenshot.c in ImageMagick before 7.0.6-1 has
    memory leaks, causing denial of service.

    coders/jpeg.c in ImageMagick before 7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via JPEG data that
    is too short.

    The ReadOneDJVUImage function in coders/djvu.c in ImageMagick through 6.9.9-0 and 7.x
    through 7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and
    CPU consumption) via a malformed DJVU image.

    The ReadOneJNGImage function in coders/png.c in ImageMagick through 6.9.9-0 and 7.x
    through 7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (large loop and CPU
    consumption) via a malformed JNG file.

    The WriteBlob function in MagickCore/blob.c in ImageMagick before 6.9.8-10 and 7.x before
    7.6.0-0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and
    application exit) via a crafted file.

    The ReadCINImage function in coders/cin.c in ImageMagick before 6.9.9-0 and 7.x before
    7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a
    crafted file.

    The ReadOneMNGImage function in coders/png.c in ImageMagick before 6.9.9-0 and 7.x before
    7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (large loop and CPU
    consumption) via a crafted file.

    The ReadDPXImage function in coders/dpx.c in ImageMagick before 6.9.9-0 and 7.x before
    7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a
    crafted file.

    The ReadDIBImage function in coders/dib.c in ImageMagick before 6.9.9-0 and 7.x before
    7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory leak) via a crafted

  description: |
    Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus' Lyre
    attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos 5
    protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be
    obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted
    version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for
    successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and
    other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this
    part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.

    In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, use of the
    ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead
    to authentication requirements being bypassed.

    In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_ssl may dereference a
    NULL pointer when third-party modules call ap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP
    request to an HTTPS port.

    The HTTP strict parsing changes added in Apache httpd 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug
    in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past the end of its input
    string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to
    cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.

    In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, mod_mime can read one byte
    past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type response header.

    files are deployed with those permissions, which would let a local attacker run the setuid
    executable or write to the world-writable location. In the case of the "system helper"

  description: |
    The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that, when an error
    occurs and an error page is configured for the error that occurred, the original request
    and response are forwarded to the error page. This means that the request is presented to
    the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected
    behaviour is to serve content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of
    the actual HTTP method. The Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M20, 8.5.0
    to 8.5.14, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.43 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.77 did not do this. Depending on the
    original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error
    pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or
    removal of the custom error page. Notes for other user provided error pages: (1) Unless
    explicitly coded otherwise, JSPs ignore the HTTP method. JSPs used as error pages must
    must ensure that they handle any error dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual
    method. (2) By default, the response generated by a Servlet does depend on the HTTP
    method. Custom Servlets used as error pages must ensure that they handle any error
    dispatch as a GET request, regardless of the actual method.

  description: |
    Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Request Tracker (RT) 4.x before 4.0.25, 4.2.x
    before 4.2.14, and 4.4.x before 4.4.2, when the AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting
    is not in use, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a file
    upload with an unspecified content type.

    Request Tracker (RT) 4.x before 4.0.25, 4.2.x before 4.2.14, and 4.4.x before 4.4.2 does
    not use a constant-time comparison algorithm for secrets, which makes it easier for remote
    attackers to obtain sensitive user password information via a timing side-channel attack.

    Request Tracker (RT) 4.x before 4.0.25, 4.2.x before 4.2.14, and 4.4.x before 4.4.2 allows
    remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    verification tokens via a crafted URL.

    The dashboard subscription interface in Request Tracker (RT) 4.x before 4.0.25, 4.2.x
    before 4.2.14, and 4.4.x before 4.4.2 might allow remote authenticated users with certain
    privileges to execute arbitrary code via a crafted saved search name.

    Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Some of these bugs
    showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of
    these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54,
    Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    A use-after-free vulnerability with the frameloader during tree reconstruction while
    regenerating CSS layout when attempting to use a node in the tree that no longer exists.
    This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54,
    Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    A use-after-free vulnerability when using an incorrect URL during the reloading of a
    docshell. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    A use-after-free vulnerability during video control operations when a "<track>" element
    holds a reference to an older window if that window has been replaced in the DOM. This
    results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54,
    Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    A use-after-free vulnerability with content viewer listeners that results in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and
    Thunderbird < 52.2.

    A use-after-free vulnerability during specific user interactions with the input method
    editor (IME) in some languages due to how events are handled. This results in a
    potentially exploitable crash but would require specific user interaction to trigger. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    An out-of-bounds read in WebGL with a maliciously crafted "ImageInfo" object during WebGL
    operations. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird <
    52.2.

    A use-after-free and use-after-scope vulnerability when logging errors from headers for
    XML HTTP Requests (XHR). This could result in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    A use-after-free vulnerability in IndexedDB when one of its objects is destroyed in memory
    while a method on it is still being executed. This results in a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird <
    52.2.

    An out-of-bounds read vulnerability with the Opus encoder when the number of channels in
    an audio stream changes while the encoder is in use. This vulnerability affects Firefox <
    54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    Characters from the "Canadian Syllabics" unicode block can be mixed with characters from
    other unicode blocks in the addressbar instead of being rendered as their raw "punycode"
    form, allowing for domain name spoofing attacks through character confusion. The current
    Unicode standard allows characters from "Aspirational Use Scripts" such as Canadian
    Syllabics to be mixed with Latin characters in the "moderately restrictive" IDN profile.
    We have changed Firefox behavior to match the upcoming Unicode version 10.0 which removes
    this category and treats them as "Limited Use Scripts.". This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 54, Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.

    A number of security vulnerabilities in the Graphite 2 library including out-of-bounds
    reads, buffer overflow reads and writes, and the use of uninitialized memory. These issues
    were addressed in Graphite 2 version 1.3.10. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 54,
    Firefox ESR < 52.2, and Thunderbird < 52.2.
