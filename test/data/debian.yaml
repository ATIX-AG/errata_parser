    Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to
    version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may
    cause crash. This type of crash may be caused by `#define MATCH(s, m) (strncmp(s, m, n =
    sizeof(m) - 1) == 0)`, which will make `n` bigger and trigger out-of-bound access when
    `IS_NON_WS(s[n])`. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.

    Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to
    version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may
    cause a crash. This type of crash may be caused by a URL ending with `%`. Version 1.13.8
    contains a patch for this issue.

    Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to
    version 1.13.8, when parsing each line of a sdp message, `rest = record + 2` will access
    the memory behind `\0` and cause an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can send a message
    with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, causing a crash or more serious consequence, such as remote
    code execution. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.

    An issue was discovered in the libsofia-sip fork in drachtio-server before 0.8.20. It
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted UDP
    message that leads to a failure of the libsofia-sip-ua/tport/tport.c self assertion.

    Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the IETF RFC3261
    specification. In affected versions Sofia-SIP **lacks both message length and attributes
    length checks** when it handles STUN packets, leading to controllable heap-over-flow. For
    example, in stun_parse_attribute(), after we get the attribute's type and length value,
    the length will be used directly to copy from the heap, regardless of the message's left
    size. Since network users control the overflowed length, and the data is written to heap
    chunks later, attackers may achieve remote code execution by heap grooming or other
    exploitation methods. The bug was introduced 16 years ago in sofia-sip 1.12.4 (plus some
    patches through 12/21/2006) to in tree libs with git-svn-id:
    http://svn.freeswitch.org/svn/freeswitch/trunk@3774 d0543943-73ff-0310-b7d9-9358b9ac24b2.
    Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

    cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required to get the cups
    printing service working on operating systems other than macos. If you use the Backend
    Error Handler (beh) to create an accessible network printer, this security vulnerability
    can cause remote code execution. `beh.c` contains the line `retval = system(cmdline) >>
    8;` which calls the `system` command with the operand `cmdline`. `cmdline` contains
    multiple user controlled, unsanitized values. As a result an attacker with network access
    to the hosted print server can exploit this vulnerability to inject system commands which
    are executed in the context of the running server. This issue has been addressed in commit
    `8f2740357` and is expected to be bundled in the next release. Users are advised to
    upgrade when possible and to restrict access to network printers in the meantime.

  description: |
    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where unauthorized access to the execution of the
    setuid file with capabilities was found in the Linux kernel’s OverlayFS subsystem in how a
    user copies a capable file from a nosuid mount into another mount. This uid mapping bug
    allows a local user to escalate their privileges on the system.

    qfq_change_class in net/sched/sch_qfq.c in the Linux kernel before 6.2.13 allows an
    out-of-bounds write because lmax can exceed QFQ_MIN_LMAX.

    In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing
    batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel
    memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous
    sets are mishandled.

    matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. In versions
    prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or
    impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's
    ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating

    In libxml2 before 2.10.4, parsing of certain invalid XSD schemas can lead to a NULL
    pointer dereference and subsequently a segfault. This occurs in xmlSchemaFixupComplexType
    in xmlschemas.c.

    An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.4. When hashing empty dict strings in a
    crafted XML document, xmlDictComputeFastKey in dict.c can produce non-deterministic
    values, leading to various logic and memory errors, such as a double free. This behavior
    occurs because there is an attempt to use the first byte of an empty string, and any value
    is possible (not solely the '\0' value).

    A flaw was found in openvswitch (OVS). When processing an IP packet with protocol 0, OVS
    will install the datapath flow without the action modifying the IP header. This issue
    results (for both kernel and userspace datapath) in installing a datapath flow matching
    all IP protocols (nw_proto is wildcarded) for this flow, but with an incorrect action,
    possibly causing incorrect handling of other IP packets with a != 0 IP protocol that
    matches this dp flow.

    CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo, a 2D graphics library. Prior to version
    2.7.0, Cairo can send requests to external hosts when processing SVG files. A malicious
    actor could send a specially crafted SVG file that allows them to perform a server-side
    request forgery or denial of service. Version 2.7.0 disables CairoSVG's ability to access
    other files online by default.

    If Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.82, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.67, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.26 or 10.1.0-M1 to
    10.1.0 was configured to ignore invalid HTTP headers via setting rejectIllegalHeader to
    false (the default for 8.5.x only), Tomcat did not reject a request containing an invalid
    Content-Length header making a request smuggling attack possible if Tomcat was located
    behind a reverse proxy that also failed to reject the request with the invalid header.

    The JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83, 9.0.40 to 9.0.68 and 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1
    did not escape the type, message or description values. In some circumstances these are
    constructed from user provided data and it was therefore possible for users to supply
    values that invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.

    When using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a reverse proxy via HTTP that
    include the X-Forwarded-Proto header set to https, session cookies created by Apache
    Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.0.-M2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.5, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.71 and 8.5.0 to
    8.5.85 did not include the secure attribute. This could result in the user agent
    transmitting the session cookie over an insecure channel.

    IBPB may not prevent return branch predictions from being specified by pre-IBPB branch
    targets leading to a potential information disclosure.

    x86: speculative vulnerability in 32bit SYSCALL path Due to an oversight in the very
    original Spectre/Meltdown security work (XSA-254), one entrypath performs its
    speculation-safety actions too late. In some configurations, there is an unprotected RET
    instruction which can be attacked with a variety of speculative attacks.

    x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where host assisted address
    translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run
    guests in so called shadow mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both
    shadow page tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests,
    Xen additionally runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the
    log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error
    handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory
    allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the
    worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for
    on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the
    log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established
    shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing
    them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.

    x86/HVM pinned cache attributes mis-handling T[his CNA information record relates to
    multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
    To allow cachability control for HVM guests with passed through devices, an interface
    exists to explicitly override defaults which would otherwise be put in place. While not
    exposed to the affected guests themselves, the interface specifically exists for domains
    controlling such guests. This interface may therefore be used by not fully privileged
    entities, e.g. qemu running deprivileged in Dom0 or qemu running in a so called
    stub-domain. With this exposure it is an issue that - the number of the such controlled
    regions was unbounded (CVE-2022-42333), - installation and removal of such regions was not
    properly serialized (CVE-2022-42334).

    A possible open redirect vulnerability in the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack
    >= 6.0.0 that could allow attackers to redirect users to a malicious website.

    A open redirect vulnerability exists in Action Pack >= 6.0.0 that could allow an attacker
    to craft a "X-Forwarded-Host" headers in combination with certain "allowed host" formats
    can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a
    malicious website.

    A code injection vulnerability exists in the Active Storage >= v5.2.0 that could allow an
    attacker to execute code via image_processing arguments.

    An XSS Vulnerability in Action Pack >= 5.2.0 and < 5.2.0 that could allow an attacker to
    bypass CSP for non HTML like responses.

    Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Under certain
    circumstances response bodies will not be closed. In the event a response is *not*
    notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local
    state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests.This
    has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and 5.2.6.1. Upgrading is highly
    recommended, but to work around this problem a middleware described in GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9
    can be used.

    A XSS Vulnerability in Action View tag helpers >= 5.2.0 and < 5.2.0 which would allow an
    attacker to inject content if able to control input into specific attributes.

    A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch <6.0.6.1,< 6.1.7.1, and
    <7.0.4.1. Specially crafted cookies, in combination with a specially crafted
    X_FORWARDED_HOST header can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of
    catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and
    memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release
    should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

    A vulnerability in ActiveRecord <6.0.6.1, v6.1.7.1 and v7.0.4.1 related to the
    sanitization of comments. If malicious user input is passed to either the `annotate` query
    method, the `optimizer_hints` query method, or through the QueryLogs interface which
    automatically adds annotations, it may be sent to the database withinsufficient
    sanitization and be able to inject SQL outside of the comment.

    A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch <6.1.7.1 and <7.0.4.1
    related to the If-None-Match header. A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can
    cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on
    a version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and
    memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release
    should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.

    A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Active Support <6.1.7.1 and <7.0.4.1. A
    specially crafted string passed to the underscore method can cause the regular expression
    engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use
    large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability.

    multipath-tools 0.7.7 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root access,
    as exploited in conjunction with CVE-2022-41974. Local users able to access /dev/shm can
    change symlinks in multipathd due to incorrect symlink handling, which could lead to
    controlled file writes outside of the /dev/shm directory. This could be used indirectly
    for local privilege escalation to root.

    multipath-tools 0.7.0 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root access,
    as exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users able to write to
    UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This
    can lead to local privilege escalation to root. This occurs because an attacker can repeat
    a keyword, which is mishandled because arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR.

    An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability exists in curl

    response can be compressed multiple times and potentially with differentalgorithms. The
    number of acceptable "links" in this "decompression chain" wascapped, but the cap was
    implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually
    unlimited number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a
    decompression chain could result in a "malloc bomb", making curl end up spending enormous
    amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.

    being overwritten with NUL value, which might lead to unauthorized data access or
    modification. 

    In PHP 8.0.X before 8.0.28, 8.1.X before 8.1.16 and 8.2.X before 8.2.3, excessive number

    GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters in
    the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function
    in its implementation of the etags program. For example, a victim may use the "etags -u *"
    command (suggested in the etags documentation) in a situation where the current working
    directory has contents that depend on untrusted input.

    An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. In ruby-mode.el, the
    ruby-find-library-file function has a local command injection vulnerability. The
    ruby-find-library-file function is an interactive function, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside
    the function, the external command gem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the
    feature-name parameters are not escaped. Thus, malicious Ruby source files may cause
    commands to be executed.

    An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. htmlfontify.el has a command injection
    vulnerability. In the hfy-istext-command function, the parameter file and parameter srcdir
    come from external input, and parameters are not escaped. If a file name or directory name
    contains shell metacharacters, code may be executed.

    issue is similar to GHSA-9pfh-r8x4-w26w. Possible buffer overread when parsing a certain
    STUN message. The vulnerability affects applications that uses STUN including PJNATH and
    PJSUA-LIB. The patch is available as commit in the master branch.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
    implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In
    versions prior to and including 2.12.1 a stack buffer overflow vulnerability affects PJSIP
    users that use STUN in their applications, either by: setting a STUN server in their
    account/media config in PJSUA/PJSUA2 level, or directly using `pjlib-util/stun_simple`
    API. A patch is available in commit 450baca which should be included in the next release.
    There are no known workarounds for this issue.

    In Sangoma Asterisk through 16.28.0, 17.x and 18.x through 18.14.0, and 19.x through
    19.6.0, an incoming Setup message to addons/ooh323c/src/ooq931.c with a malformed Calling
    or Called Party IE can cause a crash.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. In versions
    of PJSIP prior to 2.13 the PJSIP parser, PJMEDIA RTP decoder, and PJMEDIA SDP parser are
    affeced by a buffer overflow vulnerability. Users connecting to untrusted clients are at
    risk. This issue has been patched and is available as commit c4d3498 in the master branch
    and will be included in releases 2.13 and later. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
    no known workarounds for this issue.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. When
    processing certain packets, PJSIP may incorrectly switch from using SRTP media transport
    to using basic RTP upon SRTP restart, causing the media to be sent insecurely. The
    vulnerability impacts all PJSIP users that use SRTP. The patch is available as commit
    d2acb9a in the master branch of the project and will be included in version 2.13. Users
    are advised to manually patch or to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    vulnerability.

    A use-after-free in res_pjsip_pubsub.c in Sangoma Asterisk 16.28, 18.14, 19.6, and

    Git is a revision control system. Using a specially-crafted repository, Git prior to
    versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and
    2.30.8 can be tricked into using its local clone optimization even when using a non-local
    transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory
    contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link.
    These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's
    filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration
    in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253. A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2
    v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If upgrading
    is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available. Avoid cloning repositories from
    untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules`. Instead, consider cloning repositories
    without recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git submodule update` at
    each layer. Before doing so, inspect each new `.gitmodules` file to ensure that it does
    not contain suspicious module URLs.

    Git, a revision control system, is vulnerable to path traversal prior to versions 2.39.2,
    2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8. By feeding a
    crafted input to `git apply`, a path outside the working tree can be overwritten as the
    user who is running `git apply`. A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2,
    v2.38.4, v2.37.6, v2.36.5, v2.35.7, v2.34.7, v2.33.7, v2.32.6, v2.31.7, and v2.30.8. As a
    workaround, use `git apply --stat` to inspect a patch before applying; avoid applying one
    that creates a symbolic link and then creates a file beyond the symbolic link.

    Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort detection engine that
    could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured File Policy for
    HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of modified HTTP packets used in
    chunked responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP
    packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
    bypass a configured File Policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.

    Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort detection engine that
    could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured file policies on
    an affected system. The vulnerability is due to errors in how the Snort detection engine
    handles specific HTTP responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
    crafted HTTP packets that would flow through an affected system. A successful exploit
    could allow the attacker to bypass the configured file policies and deliver a malicious
    payload to the protected network.

    Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort detection engine that
    could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file policy for
    HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of an HTTP range header. An attacker
    could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an affected
    device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file policy for
    HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.

    Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability with TCP Fast Open (TFO) when used
    in conjunction with the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote
    attacker to bypass a configured file policy for HTTP. The vulnerability is due to
    incorrect detection of the HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the
    TFO connection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
    TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could
    allow the attacker to bypass configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a
    malicious payload.

    Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort application detection
    engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured
    policies on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the detection
    algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets that
    would flow through an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
    bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network.

    Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort detection engine that
    could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file policy for
    HTTP. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of specific HTTP header parameters.
    An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an
    affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured file
    policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.

    A vulnerability in Server Name Identification (SNI) request filtering of Cisco Web
    Security Appliance (WSA), Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and the Snort detection
    engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering technology on
    an affected device and exfiltrate data from a compromised host. This vulnerability is due
    to inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
    by using data from the SSL client hello packet to communicate with an external server. A
    successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute a command-and-control attack on a
    compromised host and perform additional data exfiltration attacks.

    Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the way the Snort detection
    engine processes ICMP traffic that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
    cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due
    to improper memory resource management while the Snort detection engine is processing ICMP
    packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of ICMP packets
    through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust
    resources on the affected device, causing the device to reload.

  description: |
    A timing side-channel in the handling of RSA ClientKeyExchange messages was discovered in
    GnuTLS. This side-channel can be sufficient to recover the key encrypted in the RSA
    ciphertext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
    decryption the attacker would need to send a large amount of specially crafted messages to
    the vulnerable server. By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the
    attacker would be able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that connection.

  description: |
    An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability was discovered in HAProxy which could
    crash the service. This issue could allow an authenticated remote attacker to run a
    specially crafted malicious server in an OpenShift cluster. The biggest impact is to
    availability.

    HAProxy before 2.7.3 may allow a bypass of access control because HTTP/1 headers are
    inadvertently lost in some situations, aka "request smuggling." The HTTP header parsers in
    HAProxy may accept empty header field names, which could be used to truncate the list of
    HTTP headers and thus make some headers disappear after being parsed and processed for
    HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the impact is limited because the headers
    disappear before being parsed and processed, as if they had not been sent by the client.
    The fixed versions are 2.7.3, 2.6.9, 2.5.12, 2.4.22, 2.2.29, and 2.0.31.

    The fix for CVE-2022-3437 included changing memcmp to be constant time and a workaround
    for a compiler bug by adding "!= 0" comparisons to the result of memcmp. When these
    patches were backported to the heimdal-7.7.1 and heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly
    other branches) a logic inversion sneaked in causing the validation of message integrity
    codes in gssapi/arcfour to be inverted.

  description: |
    AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation
    will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal
    sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the
    special case of "in place" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed.
    Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both
    unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q
    (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).

    A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which
    could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style
    attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a
    very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA
    padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is
    commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An
    attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use
    this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.
    After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
    secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data
    sent over that connection.

    The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the
    "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload data. If the function
    succeeds then the "name_out", "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to
    buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those
    buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data.
    In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header
    argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees
    this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This
    could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for
    parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read()
    are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also
    directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL
    functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which
    are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable
    because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a
    failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the
    decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also
    impacted by this issue.

    The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming
    ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the
    SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by
    end user applications.

    The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter
    BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of
    the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS
    recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function
    returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain
    is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains
    internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on
    to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
    likely result in a crash.



    This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which
    may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on
    the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
    PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream,
    SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.

    Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include
    i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and
    i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.

    The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.





    There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an
    X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure
    definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as
    ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp
    as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the
    application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker
    to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
    enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both
    the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the
    attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400
    address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is
    most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for
    retrieving CRLs over a network.

    A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffinfo.c in TIFFReadRawDataStriped()
    function. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF file to the tiffinfo tool,
    triggering a heap buffer overflow issue and causing a crash that leads to a denial of
    service.

    A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in Libtiffs' tiffcp.c in main() function. This flaw
    allows an attacker to pass a crafted TIFF file to the tiffcp tool, triggering a stack
    buffer overflow issue, possibly corrupting the memory, and causing a crash that leads to a
    denial of service.

    LibTIFF master branch has an out-of-bounds read in LZWDecode in libtiff/tif_lzw.c:619,
    allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that
    compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit b4e79bfa.

    Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.4.0 allows attackers to cause a
    denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources,
    the fix is available with commit f3a5e010.

    There is a double free or corruption in rotateImage() at tiffcrop.c:8839 found in libtiff
    4.4.0rc1

    A flaw was found in libtiff 4.4.0rc1. There is a sysmalloc assertion fail in rotateImage()
    at tiffcrop.c:8621 that can cause program crash when reading a crafted input.

    It was found in libtiff 4.4.0rc1 that there is an invalid pointer free operation in
    TIFFClose() at tif_close.c:131 called by tiffcrop.c:2522 that can cause a program crash
    and denial of service while processing crafted input.

    libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a uint32_t underflow that can lead to out of bounds read
    and write. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to tiffcrop (likely via tricking a user
    to run tiffcrop on it with certain parameters) could cause a crash or in some cases,
    further exploitation.

    libtiff's tiffcrop utility has a improper input validation flaw that can lead to out of
    bounds read and ultimately cause a crash if an attacker is able to supply a crafted file
    to tiffcrop.

    libtiff's tiffcrop tool has a uint32_t underflow which leads to out of bounds read and
    write in the extractContigSamples8bits routine. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to
    tiffcrop could trigger this flaw, most likely by tricking a user into opening the crafted
    file with tiffcrop. Triggering this flaw could cause a crash or potentially further
    exploitation.

    LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds read in extractImageSection in tools/tiffcrop.c:6905,
    allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that
    compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 48d6ece8.

    Multiple heap buffer overflows in tiffcrop.c utility in libtiff library Version 4.4.0

    attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile
    libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit e8131125.

    A stack overflow was discovered in the _TIFFVGetField function of Tiffsplit v4.4.0. This
    vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted TIFF file
    parsed by the "tiffsplit" or "tiffcrop" utilities.

    processCropSelections in tools/tiffcrop.c in LibTIFF through 4.5.0 has a heap-based buffer
    overflow (e.g., "WRITE of size 307203") via a crafted TIFF image.

    Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism to allow
    defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a
    `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and the
    attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes,
    multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge
    number of attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge.
    These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of
    the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes
    from a file, but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially, the failure mode
    depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index or both. This integer
    overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote code
    execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going
    back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
    issue.

    Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability
    affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to
    the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would
    be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a
    Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who
    set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare
    vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are
    vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config
    specified in `C:\.git\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by
    starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable
    to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and
    remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or
    extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g.
    `C:\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.

    Git is a distributed revision control system. Git prior to versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2,
    2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5, is vulnerable to privilege escalation
    in all platforms. An unsuspecting user could still be affected by the issue reported in
    CVE-2022-24765, for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that is
    owned by them, but where an attacker could create a git repository. Versions 2.37.1,
    2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5 contain a patch for this issue.
    The simplest way to avoid being affected by the exploit described in the example is to
    avoid running git as root (or an Administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce its
    use to a minimum. While a generic workaround is not possible, a system could be hardened
    from the exploit described in the example by removing any such repository if it exists
    already and creating one as root to block any future attacks.

    Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system. Versions prior to
    2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 are subject to exposure
    of sensitive information to a malicious actor. When performing a local clone (where the
    source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the
    source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to
    the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A
    malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link
    pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by
    having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a
    malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source,
    provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic
    links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions
    published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning
    untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either
    by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the
    `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with
    `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.

    Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system. `git shell` is a
    restricted login shell that can be used to implement Git's push/pull functionality via
    SSH. In versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and
    2.37.4, the function that splits the command arguments into an array improperly uses an
    `int` to represent the number of entries in the array, allowing a malicious actor to
    intentionally overflow the return value, leading to arbitrary heap writes. Because the
    resulting array is then passed to `execv()`, it is possible to leverage this attack to
    gain remote code execution on a victim machine. Note that a victim must first allow access
    to `git shell` as a login shell in order to be vulnerable to this attack. This problem is
    patched in versions 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 and
    users are advised to upgrade to the latest version. Disabling `git shell` access via
    remote logins is a viable short-term workaround.

    Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display commits in an arbitrary
    format using its `--format` specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to `git
    archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there
    is a integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored
    improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be
    triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting
    machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered indirectly through git
    archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format specifiers inside of files
    within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary
    heap writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in
    the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade.
    Users who are unable to upgrade should disable `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If
    you expose git archive via `git daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global
    daemon.uploadArch false`.

  description: |
    When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback
    (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS`
    option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which
    used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and
    either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent
    `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is changed
    from a PUT to a POST.

    A use after free vulnerability exists in curl <7.87.0. Curl can be asked to *tunnel*
    virtually all protocols it supports through an HTTP proxy. HTTP proxies can (and often do)
    deny such tunnel operations. When getting denied to tunnel the specific protocols SMB or
    TELNET, curl would use a heap-allocated struct after it had been freed, in its transfer
    shutdown code path.

    Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate large amounts of
    memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due to a lack of free memory. We are not
    aware of any cases where this has been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the
    checking of access permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic
    update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory allocated to clients
    that are not permitted to send updates is released immediately upon rejection. The scope
    of this vulnerability is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make
    dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be released again very
    quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending
    a flood of unaccepted dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to
    achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlier branches are also affected,
    but through exhaustion of internal resources rather than memory constraints. This may
    reduce performance but should not be a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we
    don't intend to address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects BIND
    9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and
    9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.

    BIND 9 resolver can crash when stale cache and stale answers are enabled, option
    `stale-answer-client-timeout` is set to a positive integer, and the resolver receives an
    RRSIG query. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through
    9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.

    This issue can affect BIND 9 resolvers with `stale-answer-enable yes;` that also make use
    of the option `stale-answer-client-timeout`, configured with a value greater than zero. If
    the resolver receives many queries that require recursion, there will be a corresponding
    increase in the number of clients that are waiting for recursion to complete. If there are
    sufficient clients already waiting when a new client query is received so that it is
    necessary to SERVFAIL the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM `recursive-clients` limit
    and soft quota), then it is possible for a race to occur between providing a stale answer
    to this older client and sending an early timeout SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion
    failure. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through
    9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.

    A OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in Node.js versions <14.20.0, <16.20.0,
    <18.5.0 due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check that can easily be bypassed because
    IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP address is invalid before making DBS requests
    allowing rebinding attacks.

    The llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1 and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js does not
    correctly parse and validate Transfer-Encoding headers and can lead to HTTP Request
    Smuggling (HRS).

    The llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1 and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js does not
    strictly use the CRLF sequence to delimit HTTP requests. This can lead to HTTP Request
    Smuggling (HRS).

    The llhttp parser <v14.20.1, <v16.17.1 and <v18.9.1 in the http module in Node.js does not
    correctly handle multi-line Transfer-Encoding headers. This can lead to HTTP Request
    Smuggling (HRS).

    A weak randomness in WebCrypto keygen vulnerability exists in Node.js 18 due to a change
    with EntropySource() in SecretKeyGenTraits::DoKeyGen() in src/crypto/crypto_keygen.cc.
    There are two problems with this: 1) It does not check the return value, it assumes
    EntropySource() always succeeds, but it can (and sometimes will) fail. 2) The random data
    returned byEntropySource() may not be cryptographically strong and therefore not suitable
    as keying material.

    The llhttp parser in the http module in Node v18.7.0 does not correctly handle header
    fields that are not terminated with CLRF. This may result in HTTP Request Smuggling.

    A OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in Node.js versions <14.21.1, <16.18.1,
    <18.12.1, <19.0.1 due to an insufficient IsAllowedHost check that can easily be bypassed
    because IsIPAddress does not properly check if an IP address is invalid before making DBS
    requests allowing rebinding attacks.The fix for this issue in

    An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel Intel’s iSMT SMBus host
    controller driver in the way a user triggers the I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_DATA (with the ioctl
    I2C_SMBUS) with malicious input data. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system.

    A vulnerability has been found in Linux Kernel and classified as critical. Affected by
    this vulnerability is the function area_cache_get of the file
    drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfpcore/nfp_cppcore.c of the component IPsec. The
    manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this
    issue. The identifier VDB-211045 was assigned to this vulnerability.

    A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected
    by this vulnerability is the function follow_page_pte of the file mm/gup.c of the
    component BPF. The manipulation leads to race condition. The attack can be launched
    remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211921
    was assigned to this vulnerability.

    There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and the
    IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag,
    which signals that the operation won't use current->nsproxy, so its reference counter is
    not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files
    will call the get_uts function which will use current->nsproxy leading to invalidly
    decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We
    recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above

    An out-of-bounds(OOB) memory access vulnerability was found in vmwgfx driver in
    drivers/gpu/vmxgfx/vmxgfx_kms.c in GPU component in the Linux kernel with device file
    '/dev/dri/renderD128 (or Dxxx)'. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user account on
    the system to gain privilege, causing a denial of service(DoS).

    In drivers/media/dvb-core/dmxdev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.10, there is a
    use-after-free caused by refcount races, affecting dvb_demux_open and dvb_dmxdev_release.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.10. l2cap_config_req in
    net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c has an integer wraparound via L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets.

    In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control
    subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a
    crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with "tc qdisc" and "tc class"
    commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c.

    A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux Kernel.
    This issue could allow the leakage of both stack and heap addresses, and potentially allow
    Local Privilege Escalation to the root user via arbitrary code execution.

    A use after free vulnerability exists in the ALSA PCM package in the Linux
    Kernel. SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_{READ|WRITE}32 is missing locks that can be used in a
    use-after-free that can result in a priviledge escalation to gain ring0 access from the
    system user. We recommend upgrading past commit 56b88b50565cd8b946a2d00b0c83927b7ebb055e


    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in rawv6_push_pending_frames in net/ipv6/raw.c
    in the network subcomponent in the Linux kernel. This flaw causes the system to crash.

    cbq_classify in net/sched/sch_cbq.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers to
    cause a denial of service (slab-out-of-bounds read) because of type confusion
    (non-negative numbers can sometimes indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid
    classification results).

    atm_tc_enqueue in net/sched/sch_atm.c in the Linux kernel through 6.1.4 allows attackers
    to cause a denial of service because of type confusion (non-negative numbers can sometimes
    indicate a TC_ACT_SHOT condition rather than valid classification results).

  description: |
    In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed
    in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a
    local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead
    to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists
    because a user-specified editor may contain a "--" argument that defeats a protection
    mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.

  description: |
    The Bzip2 decompression decoder function doesn't allow setting size restrictions on the
    decompressed output data (which affects the allocation size used during decompression).
    All users of Bzip2Decoder are affected. The malicious input can trigger an OOME and so a
    DoS attack

    The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead to
    excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the
    whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This
    vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very
    big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.

    Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development
    of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. Netty prior to version
    4.1.71.Final skips control chars when they are present at the beginning / end of the
    header name. It should instead fail fast as these are not allowed by the spec and could
    lead to HTTP request smuggling. Failing to do the validation might cause netty to
    "sanitize" header names before it forward these to another remote system when used as
    proxy. This remote system can't see the invalid usage anymore, and therefore does not do
    the validation itself. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.71.Final.

    Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. In versions
    prior to 4.1.86.Final, a StackOverflowError can be raised when parsing a malformed crafted
    message due to an infinite recursion. This issue is patched in version 4.1.86.Final. There
    is no workaround, except using a custom HaProxyMessageDecoder.

    Netty project is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. Starting in
    version 4.1.83.Final and prior to 4.1.86.Final, when calling `DefaultHttpHeadesr.set` with
    an _iterator_ of values, header value validation was not performed, allowing malicious
    header values in the iterator to perform HTTP Response Splitting. This issue has been
    patched in version 4.1.86.Final. Integrators can work around the issue by changing the
    `DefaultHttpHeaders.set(CharSequence, Iterator<?>)` call, into a `remove()` call, and call
    `add()` in a loop over the iterator of values.

    XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow
    a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a
    denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the
    hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation
    causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack
    overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for
    users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or
    set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code
    example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not
    care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.

    A use-after-free in WebGL extensions could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 107, Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    An optimization in WebGL was incorrect in some cases, and could have led to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 106,
    Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    A missing check related to tex units could have led to a use-after-free and potentially
    exploitable crash.<br />*Note*: This advisory was added on December 13th, 2022 after we
    better understood the impact of the issue. The fix was included in the original release of
    Firefox 105. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.6, Firefox < 105, and
    Thunderbird < 102.6.

    Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 102.5. Some of these bugs showed
    evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could
    have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 108,
    Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    A file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid
    extension, leaving a malicious extension in its place. This could potentially led to user
    confusion and the execution of malicious code.<br/>*Note*: This issue was originally
    included in the advisories for Thunderbird 102.6, but a patch (specific to Thunderbird)
    was omitted, resulting in it actually being fixed in Thunderbird 102.6.1. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 108, Thunderbird < 102.6.1, Thunderbird < 102.6, and
    Firefox ESR < 102.6.

    An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped the sandbox to
    read arbitrary files via clipboard-related IPC messages.<br>*This bug only affects
    Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 108, Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and
    the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a
    DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless
    of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was
    shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional
    capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which
    was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.

    An attacker who compromised a content process could have partially escaped the sandbox to
    read arbitrary files via clipboard-related IPC messages.<br>*This bug only affects
    Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 108, Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    A file with a long filename could have had its filename truncated to remove the valid
    extension, leaving a malicious extension in its place. This could potentially led to user
    confusion and the execution of malicious code.<br/>*Note*: This issue was originally
    included in the advisories for Thunderbird 102.6, but a patch (specific to Thunderbird)
    was omitted, resulting in it actually being fixed in Thunderbird 102.6.1. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 108, Thunderbird < 102.6.1, Thunderbird < 102.6, and
    Firefox ESR < 102.6.

    Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Valentin Gosu, Olli Pettay, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 102.5. Some of these bugs showed
    evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could
    have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 108,
    Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    A missing check related to tex units could have led to a use-after-free and potentially
    exploitable crash.<br />*Note*: This advisory was added on December 13th, 2022 after we
    better understood the impact of the issue. The fix was included in the original release of
    Firefox 105. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.6, Firefox < 105, and
    Thunderbird < 102.6.

    An optimization in WebGL was incorrect in some cases, and could have led to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 106,
    Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    A use-after-free in WebGL extensions could have led to a potentially exploitable crash.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 107, Firefox ESR < 102.6, and Thunderbird < 102.6.

    There's a flaw in OpenEXR's ImfDeepScanLineInputFile functionality in versions prior to
    3.0.5. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to an application linked with
    OpenEXR could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk from this flaw is to
    application availability.

    There's a flaw in OpenEXR's rleUncompress functionality in versions prior to 3.0.5. An
    attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to an application linked with OpenEXR could
    cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk from this flaw is to application
    availability.

    An integer overflow could occur when OpenEXR processes a crafted file on systems where
    size_t < 64 bits. This could cause an invalid bytesPerLine and maxBytesPerLine value,
    which could lead to problems with application stability or lead to other attack paths.

    In ImfChromaticities.cpp routine RGBtoXYZ(), there are some division operations such as
    `float Z = (1 - chroma.white.x - chroma.white.y) * Y / chroma.white.y;` and
    `chroma.green.y * (X + Z))) / d;` but the divisor is not checked for a 0 value. A
    specially crafted file could trigger a divide-by-zero condition which could affect the
    availability of programs linked with OpenEXR.

    An integer overflow leading to a heap-buffer overflow was found in the DwaCompressor of
    OpenEXR in versions before 3.0.1. An attacker could use this flaw to crash an application
    compiled with OpenEXR.

    An integer overflow leading to a heap-buffer overflow was found in the DwaCompressor of
    OpenEXR in versions before 3.0.1. An attacker could use this flaw to crash an application
    compiled with OpenEXR. This is a different flaw from CVE-2021-23215.

    OpenEXR 3.1.x before 3.1.4 has a heap-based buffer overflow in
    Imf_3_1::LineCompositeTask::execute (called from
    IlmThread_3_1::NullThreadPoolProvider::addTask and
    IlmThread_3_1::ThreadPool::addGlobalTask). NOTE: db217f2 may be inapplicable.

  title: cacti -- security update
  issued: '09 Dec 2022'
  affected_source_package: cacti

  - name: cacti
    version: 1.2.16+ds1-2+deb11u1
    architecture: all
    component: main
    release: bullseye
  description: |
    Under certain ldap conditions, Cacti authentication can be bypassed with certain
    credential types.

    Cacti is an open source platform which provides a robust and extensible operational
    monitoring and fault management framework for users. In affected versions a command
    injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a
    server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The
    vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without
    authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr`
    and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After
    this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname
    corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns
    `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the
    implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file
    `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of
    the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker.
    Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server
    running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header
    `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP
    address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve
    this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check
    because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is
    bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called
    `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and
    loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a
    `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to
    execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the
    function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later
    inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection
    vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In
    order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and
    `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to
    `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily
    be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an
    `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance
    because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or
    `Device - Polling Time`. This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated
    user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type
    `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be
    prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`)
    return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...`
    `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least
    be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has
    been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first
    release containing the patch.

  description: |
    A null pointer de-reference was found in the way samba kerberos server handled missing
    sname in TGS-REQ (Ticket Granting Server - Request). An authenticated user could use this
    flaw to crash the samba server.

    Heimdal before 7.7.1 allows attackers to cause a NULL pointer dereference in a SPNEGO
    acceptor via a preferred_mech_type of GSS_C_NO_OID and a nonzero initial_response value to
    send_accept.

    A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in Samba within the GSSAPI
    unwrap_des() and unwrap_des3() routines of Heimdal. The DES and Triple-DES decryption
    routines in the Heimdal GSSAPI library allow a length-limited write buffer overflow on
    malloc() allocated memory when presented with a maliciously small packet. This flaw allows
    a remote user to send specially crafted malicious data to the application, possibly
    resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack.

    Heimdal is an implementation of ASN.1/DER, PKIX, and Kerberos. Versions prior to 7.7.1 are
    vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability in Heimdal's PKI certificate validation
    library, affecting the KDC (via PKINIT) and kinit (via PKINIT), as well as any third-party
    applications using Heimdal's libhx509. Users should upgrade to Heimdal 7.7.1 or 7.8. There
    are no known workarounds for this issue.

    PAC parsing in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.19.4 and 1.20.x before 1.20.1 has
    integer overflows that may lead to remote code execution (in KDC, kadmind, or a GSS or
    Kerberos application server) on 32-bit platforms (which have a resultant heap-based buffer
    overflow), and cause a denial of service on other platforms. This occurs in krb5_pac_parse
    in lib/krb5/krb/pac.c. Heimdal before 7.7.1 has "a similar bug."

    Heimdal before 7.7.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an
    invalid free in the ASN.1 codec used by the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
    implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In
    affected versions if the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the
    header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially
    resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A
    malicious actor located within the victim’s network may forge and send a specially crafted
    UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine.
    Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_player_create. An attacker-controlled
    'filename' argument may cause a buffer overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack
    buffer without any size validation.

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_recorder_create. An attacker-controlled
    'filename' argument may cause a buffer overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_playlist_create. An attacker-controlled
    'file_names' argument may cause a buffer overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack
    buffer without any size validation.

    Read out-of-bounds in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_recorder_create. An attacker-controlled
    'filename' argument may cause an out-of-bounds read when the filename is shorter than 4
    characters.

    Buffer overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_call_dump. An attacker-controlled 'buffer'
    argument may cause a buffer overflow, since supplying an output buffer smaller than 128
    characters may overflow the output buffer, regardless of the 'maxlen' argument supplied

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
    implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In
    affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this
    declared length is not checked against the actual received packet size, potentially
    resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA
    and RTCP. A malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length.
    Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library. In version 2.11.1 and
    prior, if incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the data field is not checked against
    the received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This
    affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP XR. A malicious actor can send a RTCP XR
    message with an invalid packet size.

    res_pjsip_t38 in Sangoma Asterisk 16.x before 16.16.2, 17.x before 17.9.3, and 18.x before
    18.2.2, and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert7, allows an attacker to trigger a crash by
    sending an m=image line and zero port in a response to a T.38 re-invite initiated by
    Asterisk. This is a re-occurrence of the CVE-2019-15297 symptoms but not for exactly the
    same reason. The crash occurs because there is an append operation relative to the active
    topology, but this should instead be a replace operation.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
    implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In
    version 2.11.1 and prior, there are various cases where it is possible that certain
    incoming RTP/RTCP packets can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue
    affects all users that use PJMEDIA and accept incoming RTP/RTCP. A patch is available as a
    commit in the `master` branch. There are no known workarounds.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
    implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In
    versions 2.11.1 and prior, parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed
    multipart can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all PJSIP
    users that accept SIP multipart. The patch is available as commit in the `master` branch.
    There are no known workarounds.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
    implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In
    versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key
    shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the
    dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table
    multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog
    list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit
    db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There
    are no known workarounds for this issue.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C
    language. Versions 2.12 and prior contain a denial-of-service vulnerability that affects
    PJSIP users that consume PJSIP's XML parsing in their apps. Users are advised to update.
    There are no known workarounds.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. Versions
    2.12 and prior contain a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users or
    users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(), pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`. Applications
    that do not use PJSUA2 and do not directly call `pjmedia_sdp_print()` or
    `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()` should not be affected. A patch is available on the `master`
    branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. There are currently no known
    workarounds.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. PJSIP
    versions 2.12 and prior do not parse incoming RTCP feedback RPSI (Reference Picture
    Selection Indication) packet, but any app that directly uses pjmedia_rtcp_fb_parse_rpsi()
    will be affected. A patch is available in the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject`
    GitHub repository. There are currently no known workarounds.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. A
    denial-of-service vulnerability affects applications on a 32-bit systems that use PJSIP
    versions 2.12 and prior to play/read invalid WAV files. The vulnerability occurs when
    reading WAV file data chunks with length greater than 31-bit integers. The vulnerability
    does not affect 64-bit apps and should not affect apps that only plays trusted WAV files.
    A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/project` GitHub repository. As a
    workaround, apps can reject a WAV file received from an unknown source or validate the
    file first.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. A buffer
    overflow vulnerability in versions 2.12 and prior affects applications that use PJSIP DNS
    resolution. It doesn't affect PJSIP users who utilize an external resolver. This
    vulnerability is related to CVE-2023-27585. The difference is that this issue is in
    parsing the query record `parse_rr()`, while the issue in CVE-2023-27585 is in
    `parse_query()`. A patch is available in the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject`
    GitHub repository. A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting
    `nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external resolver instead.

    An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 19.x. When using STIR/SHAKEN, it is possible
    to download files that are not certificates. These files could be much larger than what
    one would expect to download, leading to Resource Exhaustion. This is fixed in 16.25.2,
    18.11.2, and 19.3.2.

    An SSRF issue was discovered in Asterisk through 19.x. When using STIR/SHAKEN, it's
    possible to send arbitrary requests (such as GET) to interfaces such as localhost by using
    the Identity header. This is fixed in 16.25.2, 18.11.2, and 19.3.2.

    An issue was discovered in Asterisk through 19.x and Certified Asterisk through
    16.8-cert13. The func_odbc module provides possibly inadequate escaping functionality for
    backslash characters in SQL queries, resulting in user-provided data creating a broken SQL
    query or possibly a SQL injection. This is fixed in 16.25.2, 18.11.2, and 19.3.2, and
    16.8-cert14.

  description: |
    Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin
    responses; but timing information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests
    might have allowed them to determine the presence or length of a media file. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a
    window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in
    potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could
    have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript
    realm may be deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a
    use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go
    fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user
    confusion or spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird
    < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and
    <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a
    use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the
    request was lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it. This had the effect of
    negating SameSite cookie protections. This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method,
    allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to
    JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers
    placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have
    implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override
    the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same
    mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR
    < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may
    be produced where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in
    the buffer. <br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird on Unix-based operated systems
    (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Keyboard events reference strings like "KeyA" that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread
    addresses. Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out
    which keys were being pressed. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird
    < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could
    have been drawn over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing
    attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox
    < 107.

    Use tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be
    rendered outside the boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or
    spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and
    Firefox < 107.

    Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs
    present in Thunderbird 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and
    we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and
    Firefox < 107.

    jackson-databind before 2.13.0 allows a Java StackOverflow exception and denial of service
    via a large depth of nested objects.

    In FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.14.0-rc1, resource exhaustion can occur because of
    a lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to avoid deep wrapper array nesting,
    when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS feature is enabled. Additional fix version in 2.13.4.1
    and 2.12.17.1

    In FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.13.4, resource exhaustion can occur because of a
    lack of a check in BeanDeserializer._deserializeFromArray to prevent use of deeply nested
    arrays. An application is vulnerable only with certain customized choices for

  description: |
    Service Workers should not be able to infer information about opaque cross-origin
    responses; but timing information for cross-origin media combined with Range requests
    might have allowed them to determine the presence or length of a media file. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Through a series of popup and <code>window.print()</code> calls, an attacker can cause a
    window to go fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in
    potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Freeing arbitrary <code>nsIInputStream</code>'s on a different thread than creation could
    have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    If an out-of-memory condition occurred when creating a JavaScript global, a JavaScript
    realm may be deleted while references to it lived on in a BaseShape. This could lead to a
    use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Through a series of popups that reuse windowName, an attacker can cause a window to go
    fullscreen without the user seeing the notification prompt, resulting in potential user
    confusion or spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird
    < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    The garbage collector could have been aborted in several states and zones and
    <code>GCRuntime::finishCollection</code> may not have been called, leading to a
    use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    When a ServiceWorker intercepted a request with <code>FetchEvent</code>, the origin of the
    request was lost after the ServiceWorker took ownership of it. This had the effect of
    negating SameSite cookie protections. This was addressed in the spec and then in browsers.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method,
    allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to
    JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers
    placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have
    implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override
    the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same
    mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR
    < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    When resolving a symlink such as <code>file:///proc/self/fd/1</code>, an error message may
    be produced where the symlink was resolved to a string containing unitialized memory in
    the buffer. <br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird on Unix-based operated systems
    (Android, Linux, MacOS). Windows is unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    Keyboard events reference strings like "KeyA" that were at fixed, known, and widely-spread
    addresses. Cache-based timing attacks such as Prime+Probe could have possibly figured out
    which keys were being pressed. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird
    < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.

    If a custom mouse cursor is specified in CSS, under certain circumstances the cursor could
    have been drawn over the browser UI, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing
    attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox
    < 107.

    Use tables inside of an iframe, an attacker could have caused iframe contents to be
    rendered outside the boundaries of the iframe, resulting in potential user confusion or
    spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and
    Firefox < 107.

    Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Gabriele Svelto reported memory safety bugs
    present in Thunderbird 102.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and
    we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and
    Firefox < 107.

    A buffer overflow was found in grub_font_construct_glyph(). A malicious crafted pf2 font
    can lead to an overflow when calculating the max_glyph_size value, allocating a smaller
    than needed buffer for the glyph, this further leads to a buffer overflow and a heap based
    out-of-bounds write. An attacker may use this vulnerability to circumvent the secure boot
    mechanism.

    When rendering certain unicode sequences, grub2's font code doesn't proper validate if the
    informed glyph's width and height is constrained within bitmap size. As consequence an
    attacker can craft an input which will lead to a out-of-bounds write into grub2's heap,
    leading to memory corruption and availability issues. Although complex, arbitrary code
    execution could not be discarded.

    In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the phar uncompressor code would
    recursively uncompress "quines" gzip files, resulting in an infinite loop.

    In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the vulnerability enables network and
    same-site attackers to set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's browser which is
    treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by PHP applications.

    In PHP versions prior to 7.4.33, 8.0.25 and 8.2.12, when using imageloadfont() function in
    gd extension, it is possible to supply a specially crafted font file, such as if the
    loaded font is used with imagechar() function, the read outside allocated buffer will be
    used. This can lead to crashes or disclosure of confidential information.

    The Keccak XKCP SHA-3 reference implementation before fdc6fef has an integer overflow and
    resultant buffer overflow that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or eliminate
    expected cryptographic properties. This occurs in the sponge function interface.

    insufficient TLB flush for x86 PV guests in shadow mode For migration as well as to work
    around kernels unaware of L1TF (see XSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode.
    To address XSA-401, code was moved inside a function in Xen. This code movement missed a
    variable changing meaning / value between old and new code positions. The now wrong use of
    the variable did lead to a wrong TLB flush condition, omitting flushes where such are
    necessary.

    P2M pool freeing may take excessively long The P2M pool backing second level address
    translation for guests may be of significant size. Therefore its freeing may take more
    time than is reasonable without intermediate preemption checks. Such checking for the need
    to preempt was so far missing.

    Arm: unbounded memory consumption for 2nd-level page tables Certain actions require e.g.
    removing pages from a guest's P2M (Physical-to-Machine) mapping. When large pages are in
    use to map guest pages in the 2nd-stage page tables, such a removal operation may incur a
    memory allocation (to replace a large mapping with individual smaller ones). These memory
    allocations are taken from the global memory pool. A malicious guest might be able to
    cause the global memory pool to be exhausted by manipulating its own P2M mappings.

    lock order inversion in transitive grant copy handling As part of XSA-226 a missing
    cleanup call was inserted on an error handling path. While doing so, locking requirements
    were not paid attention to. As a result two cooperating guests granting each other
    transitive grants can cause locks to be acquired nested within one another, but in
    respectively opposite order. With suitable timing between the involved grant copy
    operations this may result in the locking up of a CPU.

    Xenstore: Guests can crash xenstored Due to a bug in the fix of XSA-115 a malicious guest
    can cause xenstored to use a wrong pointer during node creation in an error path,
    resulting in a crash of xenstored or a memory corruption in xenstored causing further
    damage. Entering the error path can be controlled by the guest e.g. by exceeding the quota
    value of maximum nodes per domain.

    Xenstore: Guests can create orphaned Xenstore nodes By creating multiple nodes inside a
    transaction resulting in an error, a malicious guest can create orphaned nodes in the
    Xenstore data base, as the cleanup after the error will not remove all nodes already
    created. When the transaction is committed after this situation, nodes without a valid
    parent can be made permanent in the data base.

    Xenstore: Guests can cause Xenstore to not free temporary memory When working on a request
    of a guest, xenstored might need to allocate quite large amounts of memory temporarily.
    This memory is freed only after the request has been finished completely. A request is
    regarded to be finished only after the guest has read the response message of the request
    from the ring page. Thus a guest not reading the response can cause xenstored to not free
    the temporary memory. This can result in memory shortages causing Denial of Service (DoS)
    of xenstored.

    Xenstore: Guests can get access to Xenstore nodes of deleted domains Access rights of
    Xenstore nodes are per domid. When a domain is gone, there might be Xenstore nodes left
    with access rights containing the domid of the removed domain. This is normally no
    problem, as those access right entries will be corrected when such a node is written
    later. There is a small time window when a new domain is created, where the access rights
    of a past domain with the same domid as the new one will be regarded to be still valid,
    leading to the new domain being able to get access to a node which was meant to be
    accessible by the removed domain. For this to happen another domain needs to write the
    node before the newly created domain is being introduced to Xenstore by dom0.

    Xenstore: Guests can crash xenstored via exhausting the stack Xenstored is using recursion
    for some Xenstore operations (e.g. for deleting a sub-tree of Xenstore nodes). With
    sufficiently deep nesting levels this can result in stack exhaustion on xenstored, leading
    to a crash of xenstored.

    Xenstore: Cooperating guests can create arbitrary numbers of nodes T[his CNA information
    record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
    correspond to which CVE.] Since the fix of XSA-322 any Xenstore node owned by a removed
    domain will be modified to be owned by Dom0. This will allow two malicious guests working
    together to create an arbitrary number of Xenstore nodes. This is possible by domain A
    letting domain B write into domain A's local Xenstore tree. Domain B can then create many
    nodes and reboot. The nodes created by domain B will now be owned by Dom0. By repeating
    this process over and over again an arbitrary number of nodes can be created, as Dom0's
    number of nodes isn't limited by Xenstore quota.

    Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of
    signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it
    directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds,
    it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in
    the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative
    value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not
    handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of
    the xenstore ring.

    Xenstore: Guests can create arbitrary number of nodes via transactions T[his CNA
    information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which
    aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] In case a node has been created in a
    transaction and it is later deleted in the same transaction, the transaction will be
    terminated with an error. As this error is encountered only when handling the deleted node
    at transaction finalization, the transaction will have been performed partially and
    without updating the accounting information. This will enable a malicious guest to create
    arbitrary number of nodes.

    An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. When parsing a multi-gigabyte XML
    document with the XML_PARSE_HUGE parser option enabled, several integer counters can
    overflow. This results in an attempt to access an array at a negative 2GB offset,
    typically leading to a segmentation fault.

    An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.3. Certain invalid XML entity definitions
    can corrupt a hash table key, potentially leading to subsequent logic errors. In one case,
    a double-free can be provoked.

    The simplified implementation of blocking reads and writes introduced in Tomcat 10 and
    back-ported to Tomcat 9.0.47 onwards exposed a long standing (but extremely hard to
    trigger) concurrency bug in Apache Tomcat 10.1.0 to 10.1.0-M12, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.18,
    9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.60 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.77 that could cause client connections to share an
    Http11Processor instance resulting in responses, or part responses, to be received by the
    wrong client.

    The fix for bug CVE-2020-9484 introduced a time of check, time of use vulnerability into
    Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M8, 10.0.0-M5 to 10.0.14, 9.0.35 to 9.0.56 and 8.5.55 to
    8.5.73 that allowed a local attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the user
    that the Tomcat process is using. This issue is only exploitable when Tomcat is configured
    to persist sessions using the FileStore.

    The documentation of Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M14, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.20, 9.0.13
    to 9.0.62 and 8.5.38 to 8.5.78 for the EncryptInterceptor incorrectly stated it enabled
    Tomcat clustering to run over an untrusted network. This was not correct. While the
    EncryptInterceptor does provide confidentiality and integrity protection, it does not
    protect against all risks associated with running over any untrusted network, particularly
    DoS risks.

  description: |
    A same-origin policy violation could have allowed the theft of cross-origin URL entries,
    leaking the result of a redirect, via <code>performance.getEntries()</code>. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4, Firefox ESR < 102.4, and Firefox < 106.

    Certain types of allocations were missing annotations that, if the Garbage Collector was
    in a specific state, could have lead to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4, Firefox ESR < 102.4, and Firefox <
    106.

    If a website called <code>window.print()</code> in a particular way, it could cause a
    denial of service of the browser, which may persist beyond browser restart depending on
    the user's session restore settings. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4,
    Firefox ESR < 102.4, and Firefox < 106.

    Mozilla developers Ashley Hale and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs
    present in Thunderbird 102.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and
    we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4, Firefox ESR < 102.4, and
    Firefox < 106.

    A same-origin policy violation could have allowed the theft of cross-origin URL entries,
    leaking the result of a redirect, via <code>performance.getEntries()</code>. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4, Firefox ESR < 102.4, and Firefox < 106.

    Certain types of allocations were missing annotations that, if the Garbage Collector was
    in a specific state, could have lead to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4, Firefox ESR < 102.4, and Firefox <
    106.

    If a website called <code>window.print()</code> in a particular way, it could cause a
    denial of service of the browser, which may persist beyond browser restart depending on
    the user's session restore settings. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4,
    Firefox ESR < 102.4, and Firefox < 106.

    Mozilla developers Ashley Hale and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs
    present in Thunderbird 102.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and
    we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.4, Firefox ESR < 102.4, and
    Firefox < 106.

    A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux
    kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended
    group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where
    a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a
    member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they
    should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the
    missed fix for the XFS.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The existing KVM SEV API has a vulnerability that
    allows a non-root (host) user-level application to crash the host kernel by creating a
    confidential guest VM instance in AMD CPU that supports Secure Encrypted Virtualization
    (SEV).

    A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/ext4/namei.c:dx_insert_block() in the Linux kernel’s
    filesystem sub-component. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause
    a denial of service.

    An issue was found in the Linux kernel in nf_conntrack_irc where the message handling can
    be confused and incorrectly matches the message. A firewall may be able to be bypassed
    when users are using unencrypted IRC with nf_conntrack_irc configured.

    Found Linux Kernel flaw in the i740 driver. The Userspace program could pass any values to
    the driver through ioctl() interface. The driver doesn't check the value of 'pixclock', so
    it may cause a divide by zero error.

    There exists a use-after-free in io_uring in the Linux kernel. Signalfd_poll() and
    binder_poll() use a waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task. It will send a POLLFREE
    notification to all waiters before the queue is freed. Unfortunately, the io_uring poll
    doesn't handle POLLFREE. This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or binder fd
    is polled with io_uring poll, and the waitqueue gets freed. We recommend upgrading past
    commit fc78b2fc21f10c4c9c4d5d659a685710ffa63659

    A race condition flaw was found in the Linux kernel sound subsystem due to improper
    locking. It could lead to a NULL pointer dereference while handling the SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC
    ioctl. A privileged local user (root or member of the audio group) could use this flaw to
    crash the system, resulting in a denial of service condition

    In binder_inc_ref_for_node of binder.c, there is a possible way to corrupt memory due to a
    use after free. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional
    execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product:
    AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-239630375References: Upstream kernel

    An issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19.
    Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free
    a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP
    VMAs.

    ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19. In
    pxa3xx_gcu_write in drivers/video/fbdev/pxa3xx-gcu.c, the count parameter has a type
    conflict of size_t versus int, causing an integer overflow and bypassing the size check.
    After that, because it is used as the third argument to copy_from_user(), a heap overflow
    may occur. NOTE: the original discoverer disputes that the overflow can actually happen.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.19.8.
    drivers/firmware/efi/capsule-loader.c has a race condition with a resultant
    use-after-free.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.19.16. Attackers able to inject WLAN
    frames could cause a buffer overflow in the ieee80211_bss_info_update function in
    net/mac80211/scan.c.

    A use-after-free in the mac80211 stack when parsing a multi-BSSID element in the Linux
    kernel 5.2 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by attackers (able to inject WLAN
    frames) to crash the kernel and potentially execute code.

    Various refcounting bugs in the multi-BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux
    kernel 5.1 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject
    WLAN frames) to trigger use-after-free conditions to potentially execute code.

    A list management bug in BSS handling in the mac80211 stack in the Linux kernel 5.1
    through 5.19.x before 5.19.16 could be used by local attackers (able to inject WLAN
    frames) to corrupt a linked list and, in turn, potentially execute code.

    In the Linux kernel 5.8 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16, local attackers able to inject WLAN
    frames into the mac80211 stack could cause a NULL pointer dereference denial-of-service
    attack against the beacon protection of P2P devices.

    URLs were subject to a potential denial of service attack via the locale parameter, which
    is treated as a regular expression.

    An issue was discovered in the HTTP FileResponse class in Django 3.2 before 3.2.15 and 4.0
    before 4.0.7. An application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack that
    sets the Content-Disposition header of a FileResponse when the filename is derived from

    An issue was discovered in Django 3.2 before 3.2.14 and 4.0 before 4.0.6. The Trunc() and
    Extract() database functions are subject to SQL injection if untrusted data is used as a
    kind/lookup_name value. Applications that constrain the lookup name and kind choice to a
    known safe list are unaffected.

    A SQL injection issue was discovered in QuerySet.explain() in Django 2.2 before 2.2.28,
    3.2 before 3.2.13, and 4.0 before 4.0.4. This occurs by passing a crafted dictionary (with
    dictionary expansion) as the **options argument, and placing the injection payload in an
    option name.

    An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.28, 3.2 before 3.2.13, and 4.0 before
    4.0.4. QuerySet.annotate(), aggregate(), and extra() methods are subject to SQL injection
    in column aliases via a crafted dictionary (with dictionary expansion) as the passed

    An issue was discovered in MultiPartParser in Django 2.2 before 2.2.27, 3.2 before 3.2.12,
    and 4.0 before 4.0.2. Passing certain inputs to multipart forms could result in an
    infinite loop when parsing files.

    The {% debug %} template tag in Django 2.2 before 2.2.27, 3.2 before 3.2.12, and 4.0
    before 4.0.2 does not properly encode the current context. This may lead to XSS.

    LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of LibreOffice with
    MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to
    LibreOffice was added. In the affected versions of LibreOffice links using that scheme
    could be constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Which when clicked
    on, or activated by document events, could result in arbitrary script execution without
    warning. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to
    7.4.1; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.6.

  description: |
    In ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1, when the function
    option_code_hash_lookup() is called from add_option(), it increases the option's refcount
    field. However, there is not a corresponding call to option_dereference() to decrement the
    refcount field. The function add_option() is only used in server responses to lease query
    packets. Each lease query response calls this function for several options, so eventually,
    the reference counters could overflow and cause the server to abort.

    In ISC DHCP 1.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1 a system with access to a
    DHCP server, sending DHCP packets crafted to include fqdn labels longer than 63 bytes,
    could eventually cause the server to run out of memory.

    Twig is a template language for PHP. Versions 1.x prior to 1.44.7, 2.x prior to 2.15.3,
    and 3.x prior to 3.4.3 encounter an issue when the filesystem loader loads templates for
    which the name is a user input. It is possible to use the `source` or `include` statement
    to read arbitrary files from outside the templates' directory when using a namespace like
    `@somewhere/../some.file`. In such a case, validation is bypassed. Versions 1.44.7,
    2.15.3, and 3.4.3 contain a fix for validation of such template names. There are no known
    workarounds aside from upgrading.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x
    before 1.37.1. The REST API publicly caches results from private wikis.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x
    before 1.37.1. There is Blind Stored XSS via a URL to the Upload Image feature.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.5, 1.36.x before 1.36.3, and 1.37.x
    before 1.37.1. A title blocked by AbuseFilter can be created via
    Special:ChangeContentModel due to the mishandling of the EditFilterMergedContent hook
    return value.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4, and 1.37.x
    before 1.37.2. Users with the editinterface permission can trigger infinite recursion,
    because a bare local interwiki is mishandled for the mainpage message.

    An XSS issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4, and 1.37.x
    before 1.37.2. The widthheight, widthheightpage, and nbytes properties of messages are not
    escaped when used in galleries or Special:RevisionDelete.

    A denial-of-service issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4,
    and 1.37.x before 1.37.2. When many files exist, requesting Special:NewFiles with actor as
    a condition can result in a very long running query.

    Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contains a
    vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it is not checked if
    the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie
    header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. The cookie
    middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not be affected by this
    issue. Only those who manually add the cookie middleware to the handler stack or construct
    the client with ['cookies' => true] are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same
    Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not
    affected by this vulnerability. Guzzle versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for this
    issue. As a workaround, turn off the cookie middleware.

    Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions the `Cookie` headers on
    requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a
    server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a
    request to a server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host, we
    should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only cookies that were
    managed by our cookie middleware would be safely removed, and any `Cookie` header manually
    added to the initial request would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the
    cookie middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there. Affected Guzzle 7
    users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier
    series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may
    consider an alternative approach to use your own redirect middleware, rather than ours. If
    you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects
    all together.

    Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions `Authorization` headers on
    requests are sensitive information. On making a request using the `https` scheme to a
    server which responds with a redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, we should not
    forward the `Authorization` header on. This is much the same as to how we don't forward on
    the header if the host changes. Prior to this fix, `https` to `http` downgrades did not
    result in the `Authorization` header being removed, only changes to the host. Affected
    Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as possible. Affected users using
    any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to
    upgrade may consider an alternative approach which would be to use their own redirect
    middleware. Alternately users may simply disable redirects all together if redirects are
    not expected or required.

    Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on requests are sensitive
    information. In affected versions when using our Curl handler, it is possible to use the
    `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which
    responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in host, scheme or
    port), if we choose to follow it, we should remove the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before
    continuing, stopping curl from appending the `Authorization` header to the new request.
    Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users
    using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a
    partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal
    of the curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not cover change in
    scheme or change in port. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed, one
    should simply disable redirects all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the
    Guzzle steam handler backend, rather than curl.

    Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers on requests
    are sensitive information. In affected versions on making a request which responds with a
    redirect to a URI with a different port, if we choose to follow it, we should remove the
    `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers from the request, before containing. Previously, we
    would only consider a change in host or scheme. Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to
    Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should
    upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in Guzzle 7.4.2,
    where a change in host would trigger removal of the curl-added Authorization header,

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.7, 1.36.x and 1.37.x before 1.37.3, and
    1.38.x before 1.38.1. XSS can occur in configurations that allow a JavaScript payload in a
    username. After account creation, when it sets the page title to "Welcome" followed by the
    username, the username is not escaped: SpecialCreateAccount::successfulAction() calls
    ::showSuccessPage() with a message as second parameter, and OutputPage::setPageTitle()
    uses text().

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.37.3 and 1.38.x before 1.38.1. The
    contributions-title, used on Special:Contributions, is used as page title without
    escaping. Hence, in a non-default configuration where a username contains HTML entities,
    it won't be escaped.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.8, 1.36.x and 1.37.x before 1.37.5, and
    1.38.x before 1.38.3. HTMLUserTextField exposes the existence of hidden users.

    reassignEdits.php), the changes will still be attributed to the IP address on
    Special:Contributions when doing a range lookup.

    In lighttpd 1.4.65, mod_wstunnel does not initialize a handler function pointer if an
    invalid HTTP request (websocket handshake) is received. It leads to null pointer
    dereference which crashes the server. It could be used by an external attacker to cause
    denial of service condition.

    A resource leak in gw_backend.c in lighttpd 1.4.56 through 1.4.66 could lead to a denial
    of service (connection-slot exhaustion) after a large amount of anomalous TCP behavior by
    clients. It is related to RDHUP mishandling in certain HTTP/1.1 chunked situations. Use of
    mod_fastcgi is, for example, affected. This is fixed in 1.4.67.

    An out-of-bounds read can occur when decoding H264 video. This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3,
    and Firefox < 105.

    When injecting an HTML base element, some requests would ignore the CSP's base-uri
    settings and accept the injected element's base instead. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    Inconsistent data in instruction and data cache when creating wasm code could lead to a
    potentially exploitable crash.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.*.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    By injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a shared subdomain
    which is not a secure context could set and thus overwrite cookies from a secure context,
    leading to session fixation and other attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    During iframe navigation, certain pages did not have their FeaturePolicy fully initialized
    leading to a bypass that leaked device permissions into untrusted subdocuments. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    Concurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe. This could lead
    to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    Mozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Sebastian Hengst, Andreas Pehrson, and
    the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 104 and Firefox
    ESR 102.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
    with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    An out-of-bounds read can occur when decoding H264 video. This results in a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3,
    and Firefox < 105.

    When injecting an HTML base element, some requests would ignore the CSP's base-uri
    settings and accept the injected element's base instead. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    Inconsistent data in instruction and data cache when creating wasm code could lead to a
    potentially exploitable crash.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.*.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    By injecting a cookie with certain special characters, an attacker on a shared subdomain
    which is not a secure context could set and thus overwrite cookies from a secure context,
    leading to session fixation and other attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    During iframe navigation, certain pages did not have their FeaturePolicy fully initialized
    leading to a bypass that leaked device permissions into untrusted subdocuments. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    Concurrent use of the URL parser with non-UTF-8 data was not thread-safe. This could lead
    to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 102.3, Thunderbird < 102.3, and Firefox < 105.

    Mozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Sebastian Hengst, Andreas Pehrson, and

    By flooding the target resolver with queries exploiting this flaw an attacker can
    significantly impair the resolver's performance, effectively denying legitimate clients
    access to the DNS resolution service.

    By sending specific queries to the resolver, an attacker can cause named to crash.

    By spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed ECDSA signature, an
    attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available
    memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.

    fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1 is vulnerable to
    arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that
    change the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using the default
    configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order
    to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can
    convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker,
    such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands
    under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running
    git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential
    trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the
    prompt.

    could still login.

    A vulnerability was found in the PCS project. This issue occurs due to incorrect
    permissions on a Unix socket used for internal communication between PCS daemons. A
    privilege escalation could happen by obtaining an authentication token for a hacluster
    user. With the "hacluster" token, this flaw allows an attacker to have complete control
    over the cluster managed by PCS.

    A permissive list of allowed inputs flaw was found in DPDK. This issue allows a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service triggered by sending a crafted Vhost header to DPDK.

    NVIDIA’s distribution of the Data Plane Development Kit (MLNX_DPDK) contains a
    vulnerability in the network stack, where error recovery is not handled properly, which
    can allow a remote attacker to cause denial of service and some impact to data integrity
    and confidentiality.

  description: |
    An attacker could have abused XSLT error handling to associate attacker-controlled content
    with another origin which was displayed in the address bar. This could have been used to
    fool the user into submitting data intended for the spoofed origin. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 102.2, Thunderbird < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 91.13, Firefox ESR <
    102.2, and Firefox < 104.

    A cross-origin iframe referencing an XSLT document would inherit the parent domain's
    permissions (such as microphone or camera access). This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
    < 102.2, Thunderbird < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 102.2, and Firefox < 104.

    Members the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 103,
    Firefox ESR 102.1, and Firefox ESR 91.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
    to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2, Thunderbird <
    91.13, Firefox ESR < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 102.2, and Firefox < 104.

    An attacker could have abused XSLT error handling to associate attacker-controlled content
    with another origin which was displayed in the address bar. This could have been used to
    fool the user into submitting data intended for the spoofed origin. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 102.2, Thunderbird < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 91.13, Firefox ESR <
    102.2, and Firefox < 104.

    A cross-origin iframe referencing an XSLT document would inherit the parent domain's
    permissions (such as microphone or camera access). This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
    < 102.2, Thunderbird < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 102.2, and Firefox < 104.

    Members the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 103,
    Firefox ESR 102.1, and Firefox ESR 91.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
    to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2, Thunderbird <
    91.13, Firefox ESR < 91.13, Firefox ESR < 102.2, and Firefox < 104.

    Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R)
    Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via
    local access.

    Mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions may allow arbitrary speculative
    code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    Intel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that is able
    to bypass their retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker
    with unprivileged user access can hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary
    speculative code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14. xfrm_expand_policies in
    net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c can cause a refcount to be dropped twice.

    nfqnl_mangle in net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.14 allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because, in the case of an nf_queue
    verdict with a one-byte nfta_payload attribute, an skb_pull can encounter a negative
    skb->len.

    A flaw was found in Samba. The security vulnerability occurs when KDC and the kpasswd
    service share a single account and set of keys, allowing them to decrypt each other's
    tickets. A user who has been requested to change their password, can exploit this flaw to
    obtain and use tickets to other services.

    A flaw was found in Samba. Some SMB1 write requests were not correctly range-checked to
    ensure the client had sent enough data to fulfill the write, allowing server memory
    contents to be written into the file (or printer) instead of client-supplied data. The
    client cannot control the area of the server memory written to the file (or printer).

    A flaw was found in Samba. The KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with any key known
    to it. By encrypting forged kpasswd requests with its own key, a user can change other
    users' passwords, enabling full domain takeover.

    A flaw was found in Samba. Samba AD users can cause the server to access uninitialized
    data with an LDAP add or modify the request, usually resulting in a segmentation fault.

    A flaw was found in the Samba AD LDAP server. The AD DC database audit logging module can
    access LDAP message values freed by a preceding database module, resulting in a
    use-after-free issue. This issue is only possible when modifying certain privileged
    attributes, such as userAccountControl.

  description: |
    curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line
    option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content
    pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables,
    libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the
    server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server
    using a clear-text network protocol.

    libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequenttransfers to
    reuse, if one of them matches the setup.Due to errors in the logic, the config matching
    function did not take 'issuercert' into account and it compared the involved paths *case
    insensitively*,which could lead to libcurl reusing wrong connections.File paths are, or
    can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all, and caneven vary depending on used
    file systems.The comparison also didn't include the 'issuer cert' which a transfer can
    setto qualify how to verify the server certificate.

    When sending data to an MQTT server, libcurl <= 7.73.0 and 7.78.0 could in some
    circumstances erroneously keep a pointer to an already freed memory area and both use that
    again in a subsequent call to send data and also free it *again*.

    A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when
    speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line
    or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This
    requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly
    legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations
    **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive
    data in clear text over the network.

    When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data
    using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple
    responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the
    in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got
    *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a
    Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS
    traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user
    thinking the attacker's injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.

    An improper authentication vulnerability exists in curl 7.33.0 to and including 7.82.0
    which might allow reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly making sure that
    the connection was authenticated with the same credentials as set for this transfer. This
    affects SASL-enabled protocols: SMPTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (openldap only).

    An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability exists in curl 4.9 to and include
    curl 7.82.0 are affected that could allow an attacker to extract credentials when follows
    HTTP(S) redirects is used with authentication could leak credentials to other services
    that exist on different protocols or port numbers.

    An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl 7.65.0 to 7.82.0 are vulnerable
    that by using an IPv6 address that was in the connection pool but with a different zone id
    it could reuse a connection instead.

    A insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability in fixed in curl 7.83.0 might leak
    authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port
    number.

    libcurl provides the `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` option to allow applications torequest details to
    be returned about a server's certificate chain.Due to an erroneous function, a malicious
    server could make libcurl built withNSS get stuck in a never-ending busy-loop when trying
    to retrieve thatinformation.

    libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSHrelated option
    had been changed that should have prohibited reuse.libcurl keeps previously used
    connections in a connection pool for subsequenttransfers to reuse if one of them matches
    the setup. However, several TLS andSSH settings were left out from the configuration match
    checks, making themmatch too easily.

    A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in a HTTP response
    to curl and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies
    make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create
    requests that become larger than the threshold that curl uses internally to avoid sending
    crazy large requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error.This denial state might
    remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match and haven't expired. Due to cookie
    matching rules, a server on `foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match for
    `bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a "sister server" to effectively cause a
    denial of service for a sibling site on the same second level domain using this method.

    curl < 7.84.0 supports "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning that a
    serverresponse can be compressed multiple times and potentially with different algorithms.
    The number of acceptable "links" in this "decompression chain" was unbounded, allowing a
    malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.The use of
    such a decompression chain could result in a "malloc bomb", makingcurl end up spending
    enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying toand returning out of memory errors.

    When curl < 7.84.0 saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local files, it makes the
    operation atomic by finalizing the operation with a rename from a temporary name to the
    final target file name.In that rename operation, it might accidentally *widen* the
    permissions for the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to more users than
    intended.

    When curl < 7.84.0 does FTP transfers secured by krb5, it handles message verification
    failures wrongly. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-In-The-Middle attack to go
    unnoticed and even allows it to inject data to the client.

  description: |
    pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was found in the jdbc driver
    for postgresql database while doing security research. The system using the postgresql
    library will be attacked when attacker control the jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc
    instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via
    `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`,
    `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. However, the driver did not verify if the
    class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This can lead to
    code execution loaded via arbitrary classes. Users using plugins are advised to upgrade.
    There are no known workarounds for this issue.

    ** DISPUTED ** In pgjdbc before 42.3.3, an attacker (who controls the jdbc URL or
    properties) can call java.util.logging.FileHandler to write to arbitrary files through the
    loggerFile and loggerLevel connection properties. An example situation is that an attacker
    could create an executable JSP file under a Tomcat web root. NOTE: the vendor's position
    is that there is no pgjdbc vulnerability; instead, it is a vulnerability for any
    application to use the pgjdbc driver with untrusted connection properties.

    When sending malicous data to kernel by ioctl cmd FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO,kernel will write
    memory out of bounds.

    There are use-after-free vulnerabilities caused by timer handler in net/rose/rose_timer.c
    of linux that allow attackers to crash linux kernel without any privileges.

    Linux disk/nic frontends data leaks T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs;
    the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Linux Block and
    Network PV device frontends don't zero memory regions before sharing them with the backend
    (CVE-2022-26365, CVE-2022-33740). Additionally the granularity of the grant table doesn't
    allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data residing in the same 4K page

    network backend may cause Linux netfront to use freed SKBs While adding logic to support
    XDP (eXpress Data Path), a code label was moved in a way allowing for SKBs having
    references (pointers) retained for further processing to nevertheless be freed.

    Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is
    using an rbtree to keep track of the foreign mappings. Updating of that rbtree is not
    always done completely with the related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which
    can be used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies of the rbtree.
    These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes
    or the inability to perform further mappings of other guests' memory pages.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.18.9. A type confusion bug in
    nft_set_elem_init (leading to a buffer overflow) could be used by a local attacker to
    escalate privileges, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-32250. (The attacker can
    obtain root access, but must start with an unprivileged user namespace to obtain
    CAP_NET_ADMIN access.) This can be fixed in nft_setelem_parse_data in
    net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.

    A flaw was found in Django REST Framework versions before 3.12.0 and before 3.11.2. When
    using the browseable API viewer, Django REST Framework fails to properly escape certain
    strings that can come from user input. This allows a user who can control those strings to
    inject malicious <script> tags, leading to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    Django REST framework (aka django-rest-framework) before 3.9.1 allows XSS because the
    default DRF Browsable API view templates disable autoescaping.

    LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is an open source web frontend for managing entries stored in
    an LDAP directory. The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the
    parameters on this page are not properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks.
    An authenticated user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when
    any other user try to access the edit profile page. The pdf editor tool has an edit pdf
    profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user
    can enter relative paths like
    ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png via
    tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon
    has the image on that path(if image is present). Both issues require an attacker to be
    able to login to LAM admin interface. The issue is fixed in version 7.9.1.

    LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP
    settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 There are cases where LAM
    instantiates objects from arbitrary classes. An attacker can inject the first constructor
    argument. This can lead to code execution if non-LAM classes are instantiated that execute
    code during object creation. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.

    LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP
    settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the session files include
    the LDAP user name and password in clear text if the PHP OpenSSL extension is not
    installed or encryption is disabled by configuration. This issue has been fixed in version
    8.0. Users unable to upgrade should install the PHP OpenSSL extension and make sure
    session encryption is enabled in LAM main configuration.

    LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP
    settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 incorrect regular
    expressions allow to upload PHP scripts to config/templates/pdf. This vulnerability could
    lead to a Remote Code Execution if the /config/templates/pdf/ directory is accessible for
    remote users. This is not a default configuration of LAM. This issue has been fixed in
    version 8.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

    LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP
    settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which
    is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc)
    files. An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a
    web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been
    fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in
    (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.

    LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP
    settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the user name field at
    login could be used to enumerate LDAP data. This is only the case for LDAP search
    configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.

  description: |
    An integer underflow in the DDS loader of Blender leads to an out-of-bounds read, possibly
    allowing an attacker to read sensitive data using a crafted DDS image file. This flaw
    affects Blender versions prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.

    An integer overflow in the processing of loaded 2D images leads to a write-what-where
    vulnerability and an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, allowing an attacker to leak
    sensitive information or achieve code execution in the context of the Blender process when
    a specially crafted image file is loaded. This flaw affects Blender versions prior to
    2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.

    A missing bounds check in the image loader used in Blender 3.x and 2.93.8 leads to
    out-of-bounds heap access, allowing an attacker to cause denial of service, memory
    corruption or potentially code execution.

  description: |
    If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able to set
    undesired attributes on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and
    Thunderbird < 91.11.

    An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when the signature was
    created. When displaying an email that contains a digital signature, the email's date will
    be shown. If the dates were different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having
    an invalid signature. If an attacker performed a replay attack, in which an old email with
    old contents are resent at a later time, it could lead the victim to believe that the
    statements in the email are current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require that the
    signature's date roughly matches the displayed date of the email. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 102 and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    An attacker could have injected CSS into stylesheets accessible via internal URIs, such as
    resource:, and in doing so bypass a page's Content Security Policy. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, Thunderbird < 91.11, and Firefox < 101.

    An iframe that was not permitted to run scripts could do so if the user clicked on a
    <code>javascript:</code> link. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR <
    91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    Session history navigations may have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102,
    and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP
    requests would have been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and
    Thunderbird < 91.11.

    A malicious website that could create a popup could have resized the popup to overlay the
    address bar with its own content, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing
    attacks. <br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating systems are
    unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird <
    102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    In the <code>nsTArray_Impl::ReplaceElementsAt()</code> function, an integer overflow could
    have occurred when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and
    Thunderbird < 91.11.

    The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Thunderbird 91.10.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.

  description: |
    An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and
    namespaces subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged
    process that are controlled by cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is
    actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of control groups. A local user could use
    this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.

    A kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in
    drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a
    special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with
    confidentiality.

    An information leak flaw was found in NFS over RDMA in the net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c
    in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an attacker with normal user privileges to leak
    kernel information.

    A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls
    DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel
    space.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s FUSE filesystem in the way a user
    triggers write(). This flaw allows a local user to gain unauthorized access to data from
    the FUSE filesystem, resulting in privilege escalation.

    A memory leak problem was found in the TCP source port generation algorithm in
    net/ipv4/tcp.c due to the small table perturb size. This flaw may allow an attacker to
    information leak and may cause a denial of service problem.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which
    can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle 'return' with proper preconditions,
    as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged
    attacker.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s sound subsystem in the way a user
    triggers concurrent calls of PCM hw_params. The hw_free ioctls or similar race condition
    happens inside ALSA PCM for other ioctls. This flaw allows a local user to crash or
    potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in drivers/net/hamradio. This
    flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service (DOS) when
    the mkiss or sixpack device is detached and reclaim resources early.

    A use-after-free vulnerabilitity was discovered in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c of linux
    that allows an attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device using 6pack driver
    from user space.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the Linux
    kernel by simulating amateur radio from the user space, resulting in a null-ptr-deref
    vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Amateur Radio AX.25 protocol
    functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This flaw allows a local user
    to crash the system.

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Amateur Radio AX.25
    protocol functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This flaw allows a
    local user to crash the system.

    A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux
    kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory,
    leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.

    The root cause of this vulnerability is that the ioctl$DRM_IOCTL_MODE_DESTROY_DUMB can
    decrease refcount of *drm_vgem_gem_object *(created in *vgem_gem_dumb_create*)
    concurrently, and *vgem_gem_dumb_create *will access the freed drm_vgem_gem_object.

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s X.25 set of standardized
    network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a
    simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local
    user to crash the system.

    Linux Kernel could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused
    by a concurrency use-after-free flaw in the bad_flp_intr function. By executing a
    specially-crafted program, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute
    arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on the system.

    A race condition was found the Linux kernel in perf_event_open() which can be exploited by
    an unprivileged user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit
    primitives such as kernel address information leak, arbitrary execution, etc.

    A flaw in Linux Kernel found in nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev() in drivers/nfc/nfcmrvl/main.c
    can lead to use after free both read or write when non synchronized between cleanup
    routine and firmware download routine.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFC core functionality due to a race
    condition between kobject creation and delete. This vulnerability allows a local attacker
    with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege to leak kernel information.

    There is a sleep-in-atomic bug in /net/nfc/netlink.c that allows an attacker to crash the
    Linux kernel by simulating a nfc device from user-space.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s KVM when attempting to set a SynIC IRQ. This issue
    makes it possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL
    pointer dereference. This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue
    specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service.

    Incomplete cleanup of multi-core shared buffers for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an
    authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

    Incomplete cleanup of microarchitectural fill buffers on some Intel(R) Processors may
    allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

    Incomplete cleanup in specific special register write operations for some Intel(R)
    Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure
    via local access.

    Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict
    cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in
    the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation
    can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information.

    st21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c in the Linux kernel
    through 5.16.12 has EVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length
    parameters.

    A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c
    and net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to
    overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat.

    In the Linux kernel before 5.17.1, a refcount leak bug was found in net/llc/af_llc.c.

    usb_8dev_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/usb_8dev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1
    has a double free.

    mcba_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/mcba_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1
    has a double free.

    ems_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/ems_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has
    a double free.

    Improper Update of Reference Count vulnerability in net/sched of Linux Kernel allows local
    attacker to cause privilege escalation to root. This issue affects: Linux Kernel versions
    prior to 5.18; version 4.14 and later versions.

    The Linux kernel before 5.17.2 mishandles seccomp permissions. The PTRACE_SEIZE code path
    allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions on setting the PT_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag.

    net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able
    to create user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect
    NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to a use-after-free.

    The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what
    source ports are used. This occurs because of use of Algorithm 4 ("Double-Hash Port
    Selection Algorithm") of RFC 6056.

    drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel before 5.17.6 is vulnerable to a denial of
    service, because of a concurrency use-after-free flaw after deallocating raw_cmd in the
    raw_cmd_ioctl function.

  description: |
    If an object prototype was corrupted by an attacker, they would have been able to set
    undesired attributes on a JavaScript object, leading to privileged code execution. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and
    Thunderbird < 91.11.

    An attacker could have injected CSS into stylesheets accessible via internal URIs, such as
    resource:, and in doing so bypass a page's Content Security Policy. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, Thunderbird < 91.11, and Firefox < 101.

    An iframe that was not permitted to run scripts could do so if the user clicked on a
    <code>javascript:</code> link. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR <
    91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    Session history navigations may have led to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102,
    and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    If there was a PAC URL set and the server that hosts the PAC was not reachable, OCSP
    requests would have been blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being shown. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and
    Thunderbird < 91.11.

    A malicious website that could create a popup could have resized the popup to overlay the
    address bar with its own content, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing
    attacks. <br>*This bug only affects Thunderbird for Linux. Other operating systems are
    unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird <
    102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    In the <code>nsTArray_Impl::ReplaceElementsAt()</code> function, an integer overflow could
    have occurred when the number of elements to replace was too large for the container. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and
    Thunderbird < 91.11.

    The Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported potential vulnerabilities present in Thunderbird 91.10.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 102, Firefox ESR < 91.11, Thunderbird < 102, and Thunderbird < 91.11.

    Squid through 4.14 and 5.x through 5.0.5, in some configurations, allows information
    disclosure because of an out-of-bounds read in WCCP protocol data. This can be leveraged

    In Squid 3.x through 3.5.28, 4.x through 4.17, and 5.x before 5.6, due to improper buffer

    The parser in accepts requests with a space (SP) right after the header name before the
    colon. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) in llhttp < v2.1.4 and < v6.0.6.

    The parse function in llhttp < 2.1.4 and < 6.0.6. ignores chunk extensions when parsing
    the body of chunked requests. This leads to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) under certain
    conditions.

    Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI is specifically
    defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in bypassing name-constrained
    intermediates. Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 was accepting URI SAN
    types, which PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a protocol allows URI
    SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.Versions of Node.js with the fix for this
    disable the URI SAN type when checking a certificate against a hostname. This behavior can
    be reverted through the --security-revert command-line option.

    Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 converts SANs (Subject Alternative
    Names) to a string format. It uses this string to check peer certificates against
    hostnames when validating connections. The string format was subject to an injection
    vulnerability when name constraints were used within a certificate chain, allowing the
    bypass of these name constraints.Versions of Node.js with the fix for this escape SANs
    containing the problematic characters in order to prevent the injection. This behavior can
    be reverted through the --security-revert command-line option.

    Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 did not handle multi-value Relative
    Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a
    single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a multi-value
    Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a Common Name that would
    allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.Affected versions of Node.js that do
    not accept multi-value Relative Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such
    attacks themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's ambiguous presentation of
    certificate subjects may be vulnerable.

    Due to the formatting logic of the "console.table()" function it was not safe to allow
    user controlled input to be passed to the "properties" parameter while simultaneously
    passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be
    "__proto__". The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an
    empty string to be assigned to numerical keys of the object prototype.Node.js >= 12.22.9,
    >= 14.18.3, >= 16.13.2, and >= 17.3.1 use a null protoype for the object these properties
    are being assigned to.

    In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further
    circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to
    prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it
    was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of
    certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell.
    This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically
    executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the
    privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be
    replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected
    3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in
    OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).

    Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software
    containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where
    containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities,
    creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file
    capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`.
    Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise
    unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file
    capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable
    programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and
    processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's
    bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation
    inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container
    security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were
    included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine)
    20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable
    capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that
    containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry
    point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable
    capabilities prior to the primary process starting.

    containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI
    implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to
    consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause
    containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other
    legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI
    implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via
    an "exec" facility. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should
    update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that
    only trusted images and commands are used.

  description: |
    A kernel information leak flaw was identified in the scsi_ioctl function in
    drivers/scsi/scsi_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a
    special user privilege (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to create issues with
    confidentiality.

    A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s DMA subsystem, in the way a user calls
    DMA_FROM_DEVICE. This flaw allows a local user to read random memory from the kernel
    space.

    A memory leak problem was found in the TCP source port generation algorithm in
    net/ipv4/tcp.c due to the small table perturb size. This flaw may allow an attacker to
    information leak and may cause a denial of service problem.

    A race condition was found the Linux kernel in perf_event_open() which can be exploited by
    an unprivileged user to gain root privileges. The bug allows to build several exploit
    primitives such as kernel address information leak, arbitrary execution, etc.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s io_uring subsystem in the way a user
    sets up a ring with IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL with more than one task completing submissions on
    this ring. This flaw allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the
    system.

    With shadow paging enabled, the INVPCID instruction results in a call to
    kvm_mmu_invpcid_gva. If INVPCID is executed with CR0.PG=0, the invlpg callback is not set
    and the result is a NULL pointer dereference.

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s KVM module, which can lead
    to a denial of service in the x86_emulate_insn in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c. This flaw occurs
    while executing an illegal instruction in guest in the Intel CPU.

    net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c in the Linux kernel through 5.18.1 allows a local user (able
    to create user/net namespaces) to escalate privileges to root because an incorrect
    NFT_STATEFUL_EXPR check leads to a use-after-free.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFC core functionality due to a race
    condition between kobject creation and delete. This vulnerability allows a local attacker
    with CAP_NET_ADMIN privilege to leak kernel information.

    There is a sleep-in-atomic bug in /net/nfc/netlink.c that allows an attacker to crash the
    Linux kernel by simulating a nfc device from user-space.

    A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's nft_set_desc_concat_parse() function .This
    flaw allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow via nft_set_desc_concat_parse() ,
    causing a denial of service and possibly to run code.

    KGDB and KDB allow read and write access to kernel memory, and thus should be restricted
    during lockdown. An attacker with access to a serial port could trigger the debugger so it
    is important that the debugger respect the lockdown mode when/if it is triggered. CVSS 3.1
    Base Score 6.7 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
    (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

    The SUNRPC subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.17.2 can call xs_xprt_free before
    ensuring that sockets are in the intended state.

    ntfsck in NTFS-3G through 2021.8.22 has a heap-based buffer overflow involving
    buffer+512*3-2. NOTE: the upstream position is that ntfsck is deprecated; however, it is
    shipped by some Linux distributions.

    An invalid return code in fuse_kern_mount enables intercepting of libfuse-lite protocol
    traffic between NTFS-3G and the kernel in NTFS-3G through 2021.8.22 when using
    libfuse-lite.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause heap exhaustion in ntfs_get_attribute_value in NTFS-3G
    through 2021.8.22.

    A file handle created in fuse_lib_opendir, and later used in fuse_lib_readdir, enables
    arbitrary memory read and write operations in NTFS-3G through 2021.8.22 when using
    libfuse-lite.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs_names_full_collate in
    NTFS-3G through 2021.8.22.

    An integer underflow in fuse_lib_readdir enables arbitrary memory read operations in
    NTFS-3G through 2021.8.22 when using libfuse-lite.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs_mft_rec_alloc in
    NTFS-3G through 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs_check_log_client_array
    in NTFS-3G through 2021.8.22.

    An attacker could have sent a message to the parent process where the contents were used
    to double-index into a JavaScript object, leading to prototype pollution and ultimately
    attacker-controlled JavaScript executing in the privileged parent process. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.9.1, Firefox < 100.0.2, Firefox for Android <
    100.3.0, and Thunderbird < 91.9.1.

    If an attacker was able to corrupt the methods of an Array object in JavaScript via
    prototype pollution, they could have achieved execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript
    code in a privileged context. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.9.1, Firefox <
    100.0.2, Firefox for Android < 100.3.0, and Thunderbird < 91.9.1.

    When displaying the sender of an email, and the sender name contained the Braille Pattern
    Blank space character multiple times, Thunderbird would have displayed all the spaces.
    This could have been used by an attacker to send an email message with the attacker's
    digital signature, that was shown with an arbitrary sender email address chosen by the
    attacker. If the sender name started with a false email address, followed by many Braille
    space characters, the attacker's email address was not visible. Because Thunderbird
    compared the invisible sender address with the signature's email address, if the signing
    key or certificate was accepted by Thunderbird, the email was shown as having a valid
    digital signature. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10.

    A malicious website could have learned the size of a cross-origin resource that supported
    Range requests. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox
    ESR < 91.10.

    A malicious webpage could have caused an out-of-bounds write in WebGL, leading to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    When exiting fullscreen mode, an iframe could have confused the browser about the current
    state of fullscreen, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    On arm64, WASM code could have resulted in incorrect assembly generation leading to a
    register allocation problem, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    A crafted CMS message could have been processed incorrectly, leading to an invalid memory
    read, and potentially further memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    An attacker could have exploited a timing attack by sending a large number of
    allowCredential entries and detecting the difference between invalid key handles and
    cross-origin key handles. This could have led to cross-origin account linking in violation
    of WebAuthn goals. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Nicolas B. Pierron, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9. Some of these
    bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of
    these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    In cifs-utils through 6.14, a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the mount.cifs ip=
    command-line argument could lead to local attackers gaining root privileges.

    cifs-utils through 6.14, with verbose logging, can cause an information leak when a file
    contains = (equal sign) characters but is not a valid credentials file.

    A malicious website could have learned the size of a cross-origin resource that supported
    Range requests. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox
    ESR < 91.10.

    A malicious webpage could have caused an out-of-bounds write in WebGL, leading to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    When exiting fullscreen mode, an iframe could have confused the browser about the current
    state of fullscreen, resulting in potential user confusion or spoofing attacks. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    On arm64, WASM code could have resulted in incorrect assembly generation leading to a
    register allocation problem, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    A crafted CMS message could have been processed incorrectly, leading to an invalid memory
    read, and potentially further memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    An attacker could have exploited a timing attack by sending a large number of
    allowCredential entries and detecting the difference between invalid key handles and
    cross-origin key handles. This could have led to cross-origin account linking in violation
    of WebAuthn goals. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Nicolas B. Pierron, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
    reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9. Some of these
    bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of
    these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.10, Firefox < 101, and Firefox ESR < 91.10.

    Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have
    a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a
    segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be
    used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do
    that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum
    number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over
    the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of
    digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this
    makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one
    of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on
    receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog
    message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When
    this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a
    diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be
    present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually,
    it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it
    off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.

  description: |
    Puma is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9,
    using `puma` with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character
    could allow HTTP request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy,
    causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client. The only proxy which
    has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the
    proxy uses persistent connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP
    pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see
    it as two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a response that the
    proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send
    another request for a different client, the second response from the first client will be
    sent to the second client. This vulnerability was patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9. As a
    workaround, do not use Apache Traffic Server with `puma`.

    Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to `puma` version `5.6.2`,
    `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails, prior to version
    `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes`
    implementation to work correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not closing
    the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information leakage. This problem is
    fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11. This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2,
    6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2. Upgrading to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the
    vulnerability.

    Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, parallel HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack
    applications. When using Puma behind a proxy that does not properly validate that the
    incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230 standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may
    disagree on where a request starts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via
    the front-end proxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and 4.3.12. Users
    are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround: when deploying a proxy in front of
    Puma, turning on any and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the
    RFC7230 standard.

    READ or WRITE methods to include CLAIMTOBE, then it is possible to impersonate another
    user to the condor_schedd. (For example to submit or remove jobs)

    An issue was discovered in HTCondor 8.8.x before 8.8.16, 9.0.x before 9.0.10, and 9.1.x
    before 9.6.0. When a user authenticates to an HTCondor daemon via the CLAIMTOBE method,
    the user can then impersonate any entity when issuing additional commands to that daemon.

  description: |
    An attacker could have sent a message to the parent process where the contents were used
    to double-index into a JavaScript object, leading to prototype pollution and ultimately
    attacker-controlled JavaScript executing in the privileged parent process. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.9.1, Firefox < 100.0.2, Firefox for Android <
    100.3.0, and Thunderbird < 91.9.1.

    If an attacker was able to corrupt the methods of an Array object in JavaScript via
    prototype pollution, they could have achieved execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript
    code in a privileged context. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.9.1, Firefox <
    100.0.2, Firefox for Android < 100.3.0, and Thunderbird < 91.9.1.

  description: |
    In libxml2 before 2.9.14, several buffer handling functions in buf.c (xmlBuf*) and tree.c
    (xmlBuffer*) don't check for integer overflows. This can result in out-of-bounds memory
    writes. Exploitation requires a victim to open a crafted, multi-gigabyte XML file. Other
    software using libxml2's buffer functions, for example libxslt through 1.1.35, is affected
    as well.

    Requests initiated through reader mode did not properly omit cookies with a SameSite
    attribute. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox
    < 100.

    The parent process would not properly check whether the Speech Synthesis feature is
    enabled, when receiving instructions from a child process. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.9.

    When reusing existing popups Firefox would have allowed them to cover the fullscreen
    notification UI, which could have enabled browser spoofing attacks. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    Firefox behaved slightly differently for already known resources when loading CSS
    resources involving CSS variables. This could have been used to probe the browser history.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, Tom Ritter and the Mozilla Fuzzing
    Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 99 and Firefox ESR 91.8. Some of these
    bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of
    these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When using Waitress
    versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does not properly validate the incoming HTTP
    request matches the RFC7230 standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on
    where one request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via
    the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There are two classes of vulnerability
    that may lead to request smuggling that are addressed by this advisory: The use of
    Python's `int()` to parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or
    `0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the string should contain
    only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was
    discarding them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This
    vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is available. When
    deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any and all functionality to make sure
    that the request matches the RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this
    functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of waitress
    instead.

    with the fix for CVE-2021-3748, which forgot to unmap the cached virtqueue elements on
    error, leading to memory leakage and other unexpected results. Affected QEMU version:
    6.2.0.

    A flaw was found in the vhost-vsock device of QEMU. In case of error, an invalid element
    was not detached from the virtqueue before freeing its memory, leading to memory leakage
    and other unexpected results. Affected QEMU versions <= 6.2.0.

    A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. An integer overflow in the
    cursor_alloc() function can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a
    subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest user
    to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the
    context of the QEMU process.

    A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double fetch of guest
    controlled values `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can lead to the
    allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A
    malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host
    or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.

    implementation. This flaw is strictly related to CVE-2018-13405. A local guest user can
    create files in the directories shared by virtio-fs with unintended group ownership in a
    scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not
    a member of the group. This could allow a malicious unprivileged user inside the guest to
    gain access to resources accessible to the root group, potentially escalating their
    privileges within the guest. A malicious local user in the host might also leverage this
    unexpected executable file created by the guest to escalate their privileges on the host
    system.

  description: |
    ecdsautils is a tiny collection of programs used for ECDSA (keygen, sign, verify).
    `ecdsa_verify_[prepare_]legacy()` does not check whether the signature values `r` and `s`
    are non-zero. A signature consisting only of zeroes is always considered valid, making it
    trivial to forge signatures. Requiring multiple signatures from different public keys does
    not mitigate the issue: `ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of
    such forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the libecdsautil
    library are affected. The issue has been fixed in ecdsautils 0.4.1. All older versions of
    ecdsautils (including versions before the split into a library and a CLI utility) are
    vulnerable.

  description: |
    A flaw was found in the vhost library in DPDK. Function vhost_user_set_inflight_fd() does
    not validate `msg->payload.inflight.num_queues`, possibly causing out-of-bounds memory
    read/write. Any software using DPDK vhost library may crash as a result of this
    vulnerability.

    A flaw was found in dpdk. This flaw allows a malicious vhost-user master to attach an
    unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD /
    VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By
    sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master exhausts available fd in the
    vhost-user slave process, leading to a denial of service.

  description: |
    Documents in deeply-nested cross-origin browsing contexts could have obtained permissions
    granted to the top-level origin, bypassing the existing prompt and wrongfully inheriting
    the top-level permissions. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR <
    91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    An improper implementation of the new iframe sandbox keyword
    <code>allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation</code> could lead to script execution
    without <code>allow-scripts</code> being present. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    Requests initiated through reader mode did not properly omit cookies with a SameSite
    attribute. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox
    < 100.

    When reusing existing popups Firefox would have allowed them to cover the fullscreen
    notification UI, which could have enabled browser spoofing attacks. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    Firefox behaved slightly differently for already known resources when loading CSS
    resources involving CSS variables. This could have been used to probe the browser history.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto, Tom Ritter and the Mozilla Fuzzing
    Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 99 and Firefox ESR 91.8. Some of these
    bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of
    these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.9, Firefox ESR < 91.9, and Firefox < 100.

    An unprivileged write to the file handler flaw in the Linux kernel's control groups and
    namespaces subsystem was found in the way users have access to some less privileged
    process that are controlled by cgroups and have higher privileged parent process. It is
    actually both for cgroup2 and cgroup1 versions of control groups. A local user could use
    this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.

    A denial of service (DOS) issue was found in the Linux kernel’s smb2_ioctl_query_info
    function in the fs/cifs/smb2ops.c Common Internet File System (CIFS) due to an incorrect
    return from the memdup_user function. This flaw allows a local, privileged (CAP_SYS_ADMIN)
    attacker to crash the system.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which
    can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle 'return' with proper preconditions,
    as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged
    attacker.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s sound subsystem in the way a user
    triggers concurrent calls of PCM hw_params. The hw_free ioctls or similar race condition
    happens inside ALSA PCM for other ioctls. This flaw allows a local user to crash or
    potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

    A flaw was found in KVM. When updating a guest's page table entry, vm_pgoff was improperly
    used as the offset to get the page's pfn. As vaddr and vm_pgoff are controllable by
    user-mode processes, this flaw allows unprivileged local users on the host to write
    outside the userspace region and potentially corrupt the kernel, resulting in a denial of
    service condition.

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in drivers/net/hamradio. This
    flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to cause a denial of service (DOS) when
    the mkiss or sixpack device is detached and reclaim resources early.

    A use-after-free vulnerabilitity was discovered in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c of linux
    that allows an attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device using 6pack driver
    from user space.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows an attacker to crash the Linux
    kernel by simulating amateur radio from the user space, resulting in a null-ptr-deref
    vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Amateur Radio AX.25 protocol
    functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This flaw allows a local user
    to crash the system.

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Amateur Radio AX.25
    protocol functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This flaw allows a
    local user to crash the system.

    A vulnerability was found in the pfkey_register function in net/key/af_key.c in the Linux
    kernel. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to gain access to kernel memory,
    leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s X.25 set of standardized
    network protocols functionality in the way a user terminates their session using a
    simulated Ethernet card and continued usage of this connection. This flaw allows a local
    user to crash the system.

    st21nfca_connectivity_event_received in drivers/nfc/st21nfca/se.c in the Linux kernel
    through 5.16.12 has EVT_TRANSACTION buffer overflows because of untrusted length
    parameters.

    A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in IPsec ESP transformation code in net/ipv4/esp4.c
    and net/ipv6/esp6.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with a normal user privilege to
    overwrite kernel heap objects and may cause a local privilege escalation threat.

    In the Linux kernel before 5.17.1, a refcount leak bug was found in net/llc/af_llc.c.

    usb_8dev_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/usb_8dev.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1
    has a double free.

    mcba_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/mcba_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1
    has a double free.

    ems_usb_start_xmit in drivers/net/can/usb/ems_usb.c in the Linux kernel through 5.17.1 has
    a double free.

    In the Linux kernel before 5.17.3, fs/io_uring.c has a use-after-free due to a race
    condition in io_uring timeouts. This can be triggered by a local user who has no access to
    any user namespace; however, the race condition perhaps can only be exploited
    infrequently.

    Buffer Overflow vulnerability in function config_input in libavfilter/vf_gblur.c in Ffmpeg
    4.2.1, allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service or other unspecified impacts.

    An issue was discovered in function filter_frame in libavfilter/vf_lenscorrection.c in
    Ffmpeg 4.2.1, allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service or other unspecified impacts
    due to a division by zero.

    An issue was discovered in function latm_write_packet in libavformat/latmenc.c in Ffmpeg
    4.2.1, allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service or other unspecified impacts due to a
    Null pointer dereference.

    A heap-use-after-free in the av_freep function in libavutil/mem.c of FFmpeg 4.2 allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code.

    A heap-use-after-free in the mpeg_mux_write_packet function in libavformat/mpegenc.c of
    FFmpeg 4.2 allows to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a crafted avi file.

    Prior to ffmpeg version 4.3, the tty demuxer did not have a 'read_probe' function assigned
    to it. By crafting a legitimate "ffconcat" file that references an image, followed by a
    file the triggers the tty demuxer, the contents of the second file will be copied into the
    output file verbatim (as long as the `-vcodec copy` option is passed to ffmpeg).

    An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility. When zgrep is
    applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can
    overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs
    due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where
    selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names.
    This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files
    on the system.

    Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers reveal
    'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization
    (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to
    the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the
    node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and
    svnserve servers are vulnerable.

    Subversion's mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption. While looking up path-based
    authorization rules, mod_dav_svn servers may attempt to use memory which has already been
    freed. Affected Subversion mod_dav_svn servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive). Servers
    that do not use mod_dav_svn are not affected.

  description: |
    <code>NSSToken</code> objects were referenced via direct points, and could have been
    accessed in an unsafe way on different threads, leading to a use-after-free and
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox <
    99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    After a VR Process is destroyed, a reference to it may have been retained and used,
    leading to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8 and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    When importing a revoked key that specified key compromise as the revocation reason,
    Thunderbird did not update the existing copy of the key that was not yet revoked, and the
    existing key was kept as non-revoked. Revocation statements that used another revocation
    reason, or that didn't specify a revocation reason, were unaffected. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 91.8.

    regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate
    features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted
    regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations
    already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's
    considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations
    designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing,
    and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to
    perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services
    accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or
    equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5.
    All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the
    latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic
    regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this
    vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.

    If a compromised content process sent an unexpected number of WebAuthN Extensions in a
    Register command to the parent process, an out of bounds write would have occurred leading
    to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    By using a link with <code>rel="localization"</code> a use-after-free could have been
    triggered by destroying an object during JavaScript execution and then referencing the
    object through a freed pointer, leading to a potential exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    When generating the assembly code for <code>MLoadTypedArrayElementHole</code>, an
    incorrect AliasSet was used. In conjunction with another vulnerability this could have
    been used for an out of bounds memory read. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.8,
    Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    Due to a layout change, iframe contents could have been rendered outside of its border.
    This could have led to user confusion or spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    Mozilla developers and community members Nika Layzell, Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto,
    and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.7. Some
    of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort
    some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    arm: guest_physmap_remove_page not removing the p2m mappings The functions to remove one
    or more entries from a guest p2m pagetable on Arm (p2m_remove_mapping,
    guest_physmap_remove_page, and p2m_set_entry with mfn set to INVALID_MFN) do not actually
    clear the pagetable entry if the entry doesn't have the valid bit set. It is possible to
    have a valid pagetable entry without the valid bit set when a guest operating system uses
    set/way cache maintenance instructions. For instance, a guest issuing a set/way cache
    maintenance instruction, then calling the XENMEM_decrease_reservation hypercall to give
    back memory pages to Xen, might be able to retain access to those pages even after Xen
    started reusing them for other purposes.

    A PV guest could DoS Xen while unmapping a grant To address XSA-380, reference counting
    was introduced for grant mappings for the case where a PV guest would have the IOMMU
    enabled. PV guests can request two forms of mappings. When both are in use for any
    individual mapping, unmapping of such a mapping can be requested in two steps. The
    reference count for such a mapping would then mistakenly be decremented twice. Underflow
    of the counters gets detected, resulting in the triggering of a hypervisor bug check.

    Insufficient cleanup of passed-through device IRQs The management of IRQs associated with
    physical devices exposed to x86 HVM guests involves an iterative operation in particular
    when cleaning up after the guest's use of the device. In the case where an interrupt is
    not quiescent yet at the time this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be
    scheduled to be retried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry
    may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a
    de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code would
    continue to assume them to be valid.

    Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation
    of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram
    before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to
    XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process
    of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode
    (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both
    operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a
    memory leak.

    race in VT-d domain ID cleanup Xen domain IDs are up to 15 bits wide. VT-d hardware may
    allow for only less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID associating a physical device with a
    particular domain. Therefore internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to the smaller value
    range. The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures has a race, allowing for VT-d domain
    IDs to be leaked and flushes to be bypassed.

    <code>NSSToken</code> objects were referenced via direct points, and could have been
    accessed in an unsafe way on different threads, leading to a use-after-free and
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox <
    99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    After a VR Process is destroyed, a reference to it may have been retained and used,
    leading to a use-after-free and potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8 and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate
    features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted
    regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations
    already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's
    considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations
    designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing,
    and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to
    perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services
    accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or
    equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5.
    All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the
    latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic
    regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this
    vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.

    If a compromised content process sent an unexpected number of WebAuthN Extensions in a
    Register command to the parent process, an out of bounds write would have occurred leading
    to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    By using a link with <code>rel="localization"</code> a use-after-free could have been
    triggered by destroying an object during JavaScript execution and then referencing the
    object through a freed pointer, leading to a potential exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    When generating the assembly code for <code>MLoadTypedArrayElementHole</code>, an
    incorrect AliasSet was used. In conjunction with another vulnerability this could have
    been used for an out of bounds memory read. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.8,
    Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    Due to a layout change, iframe contents could have been rendered outside of its border.
    This could have led to user confusion or spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    Mozilla developers and community members Nika Layzell, Andrew McCreight, Gabriele Svelto,
    and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 91.7. Some
    of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort
    some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.

    libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit f2b656e2.

    Null source pointer passed as an argument to memcpy() function within TIFFFetchNormalTag
    () in tif_dirread.c in libtiff versions up to 4.3.0 could lead to Denial of Service via
    crafted TIFF file.

    Divide By Zero error in tiffcrop in libtiff 4.3.0 allows attackers to cause a
    denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources,
    the fix is available with commit f8d0f9aa.

    Out-of-bounds Read error in tiffcp in libtiff 4.3.0 allows attackers to cause a

  description: |
    Twig is an open source template language for PHP. When in a sandbox mode, the `arrow`
    parameter of the `sort` filter must be a closure to avoid attackers being able to run
    arbitrary PHP functions. In affected versions this constraint was not properly enforced
    and could lead to code injection of arbitrary PHP code. Patched versions now disallow
    calling non Closure in the `sort` filter as is the case for some other filters. Users are
    advised to upgrade.

    An attacker could have caused a use-after-free by forcing a text reflow in an SVG object
    leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98,
    Firefox ESR < 91.7, and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    When resizing a popup after requesting fullscreen access, the popup would not display the
    fullscreen notification. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98, Firefox ESR < 91.7, and
    Thunderbird < 91.7.

    If an attacker could control the contents of an iframe sandboxed with
    <code>allow-popups</code> but not <code>allow-scripts</code>, they were able to craft a
    link that, when clicked, would lead to JavaScript execution in violation of the sandbox.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98, Firefox ESR < 91.7, and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    Previously Firefox for macOS and Linux would download temporary files to a user-specific
    directory in <code>/tmp</code>, but this behavior was changed to download them to
    <code>/tmp</code> where they could be affected by other local users. This behavior was
    reverted to the original, user-specific directory. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox for
    macOS and Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 91.7 and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    When installing an add-on, Firefox verified the signature before prompting the user; but
    while the user was confirming the prompt, the underlying add-on file could have been
    modified and Firefox would not have noticed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98,
    Firefox ESR < 91.7, and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC
    algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not
    analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and
    include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a
    result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely.
    Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of
    the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The
    amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an
    attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among
    multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects
    OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and
    3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit
    6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support customers only. It will be made available
    in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in
    OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in
    OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).

    The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can
    cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when
    parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or
    explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is
    possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit
    curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the
    certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus
    be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when
    parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus
    vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers
    consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from
    customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers -
    Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications
    that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are
    vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed
    during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the
    infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate
    will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed
    certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This
    issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of
    1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2zc).

    A flaw was found in the way HAProxy processed HTTP responses containing the "Set-Cookie2"
    header. This flaw could allow an attacker to send crafted HTTP response packets which lead
    to an infinite loop, eventually resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest
    threat from this vulnerability is availability.

    In nbd-server in nbd before 3.24, there is an integer overflow with a resultant heap-based
    buffer overflow. A value of 0xffffffff in the name length field will cause a zero-sized
    buffer to be allocated for the name, resulting in a write to a dangling pointer. This
    issue exists for the NBD_OPT_INFO, NBD_OPT_GO, and NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME messages.

    In nbd-server in nbd before 3.24, there is a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can
    cause a buffer overflow in the parsing of the name field by sending a crafted NBD_OPT_INFO
    or NBD_OPT_GO message with an large value as the length of the name.

    An attacker could have caused a use-after-free by forcing a text reflow in an SVG object
    leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98,
    Firefox ESR < 91.7, and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    When resizing a popup after requesting fullscreen access, the popup would not display the
    fullscreen notification. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98, Firefox ESR < 91.7, and
    Thunderbird < 91.7.

    If an attacker could control the contents of an iframe sandboxed with
    <code>allow-popups</code> but not <code>allow-scripts</code>, they were able to craft a
    link that, when clicked, would lead to JavaScript execution in violation of the sandbox.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98, Firefox ESR < 91.7, and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    Previously Firefox for macOS and Linux would download temporary files to a user-specific
    directory in <code>/tmp</code>, but this behavior was changed to download them to
    <code>/tmp</code> where they could be affected by other local users. This behavior was
    reverted to the original, user-specific directory. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox for
    macOS and Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 91.7 and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    When installing an add-on, Firefox verified the signature before prompting the user; but
    while the user was confirming the prompt, the underlying add-on file could have been
    modified and Firefox would not have noticed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98,
    Firefox ESR < 91.7, and Thunderbird < 91.7.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.7.3, related to mm/gup.c and
    mm/huge_memory.c. The get_user_pages (aka gup) implementation, when used for a
    copy-on-write page, does not properly consider the semantics of read operations and
    therefore can grant unintended write access, aka CID-17839856fd58.

    An issue was discovered in the FUSE filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before
    5.10.6, aka CID-5d069dbe8aaf. fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate
    situations, causing a system crash. NOTE: the original fix for this vulnerability was
    incomplete, and its incompleteness is tracked as CVE-2021-28950.

    A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was
    found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of
    the call sco_conn_del() together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected
    controllable faulting memory page. A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash
    the system or escalate their privileges on the system.

    A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function in
    drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
    consumption). This vulnerability is similar with the older CVE-2019-18808.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Bluetooth subsystem in the way user
    calls connect to the socket and disconnect simultaneously due to a race condition. This
    flaw allows a user to crash the system or escalate their privileges. The highest threat
    from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free vulnerability in the NFC stack can
    lead to a threat to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.

    A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ccp_run_aes_gcm_cmd() function that
    allows an attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is similar to the older
    CVE-2019-18808. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

    A flaw was found in the Linux SCTP stack. A blind attacker may be able to kill an existing
    SCTP association through invalid chunks if the attacker knows the IP-addresses and port
    numbers being used and the attacker can send packets with spoofed IP addresses.

    A memory leak flaw in the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs memory usage was found in the way the
    user maps some regions of memory twice using shmget() which are aligned to PUD alignment
    with the fault of some of the memory pages. A local user could use this flaw to get
    unauthorized access to some data.

    A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix
    domain socket file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and
    can potentially trigger a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the
    system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions
    prior to 5.16-rc4.

    A memory leak vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF for the Simulated
    networking device driver in the way user uses BPF for the device such that function
    nsim_map_alloc_elem being called. A local user could use this flaw to get unauthorized
    access to some data.

    A data leak flaw was found in the way XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed
    for size increase of files with unaligned size. A local attacker could use this flaw to
    leak data on the XFS filesystem otherwise not accessible to them.

    A use-after-free flaw was found in nci_request in net/nfc/nci/core.c in NFC Controller
    Interface (NCI) in the Linux kernel. This flaw could allow a local attacker with user
    privileges to cause a data race problem while the device is getting removed, leading to a
    privilege escalation problem.

    A use-after-free read flaw was found in sock_getsockopt() in net/core/sock.c due to
    SO_PEERCRED and SO_PEERGROUPS race with listen() (and connect()) in the Linux kernel. In
    this flaw, an attacker with a user privileges may crash the system or leak internal kernel
    information.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be
    missing in the timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local
    attacker with special user privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually
    stopping the system while running OSP.

    A race condition accessing file object in the Linux kernel OverlayFS subsystem was found
    in the way users do rename in specific way with OverlayFS. A local user could use this
    flaw to crash the system.

    A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect)
    in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP
    ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP
    randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and
    possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are
    indirectly affected as well.

    A double free bug in packet_set_ring() in net/packet/af_packet.c can be exploited by a
    local user through crafted syscalls to escalate privileges or deny service. We recommend
    upgrading kernel past the effected versions or rebuilding past

    Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory T[his CNA
    information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which
    aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Incoming data packets for a guest in the
    Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is ready to process them. There
    are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed
    by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop
    consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather
    long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily
    accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never
    trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the
    next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO,
    XDP, or software hashing. (CVE-2021-28714)

    An issue was discovered in fs/fuse/fuse_i.h in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. A "stall on
    CPU" can occur because a retry loop continually finds the same bad inode, aka
    CID-775c5033a0d1.

    arch/mips/net/bpf_jit.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.10 can generate undesirable machine
    code when transforming unprivileged cBPF programs, allowing execution of arbitrary code
    within the kernel context. This occurs because conditional branches can exceed the 128 KB
    limit of the MIPS architecture.

    In various setup methods of the USB gadget subsystem, there is a possible out of bounds
    write due to an incorrect flag check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege
    with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for
    exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-210292376References:
    Upstream kernel

    In several functions of binder.c, there is a possible way to represent the wrong domain to
    SELinux due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no
    additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for
    exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-200688826References:

    prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12
    allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a
    resultant out-of-bounds write.

    A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel FireDTV media card driver,
    where the user calls the CA_SEND_MSG ioctl. This flaw allows a local user of the host
    machine to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system. The highest threat from
    this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.14.15. There is an
    array-index-out-of-bounds flaw in the detach_capi_ctr function in
    drivers/isdn/capi/kcapi.c.

    In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait in
    drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia/atlantic/hw_atl/hw_atl_utils.c allows an attacker (who can
    introduce a crafted device) to trigger an out-of-bounds write via a crafted length value.

    In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in
    drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows an attacker (who can connect a crafted
    USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).

    A use-after-free exists in drivers/tee/tee_shm.c in the TEE subsystem in the Linux kernel
    through 5.15.11. This occurs because of a race condition in tee_shm_get_from_id during an
    attempt to free a shared memory object.

    pep_sock_accept in net/phonet/pep.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.8 has a refcount
    leak.

    In __f2fs_setxattr in fs/f2fs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.11, there is an
    out-of-bounds memory access when an inode has an invalid last xattr entry.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.15.11. There is a memory leak in the
    __rds_conn_create() function in net/rds/connection.c in a certain combination of
    circumstances.

    Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R)
    Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via
    local access.

    Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(R) Processors
    may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local
    access.

    A flaw was found in the sctp_make_strreset_req function in net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the
    SCTP network protocol in the Linux kernel with a local user privilege access. In this
    flaw, an attempt to use more buffer than is allocated triggers a BUG_ON issue, leading to
    a denial of service (DOS).

    A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver
    functionality in the way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a
    local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.

    A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the
    way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes
    is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or
    possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in
    drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local
    attacker with a user privilege may impact system Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel
    versions prior to 5.14 rc1.

    A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel’s cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use
    of the cgroups v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace
    isolation unexpectedly.

    A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was
    found in the way user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A
    local user could use this flaw to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till
    5.17-rc2.

    An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an
    application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open()
    performs a regular lookup. If a regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the
    server instead returns uninitialized data in the file descriptor.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in
    yam_siocdevprivate in drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c.

    An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before
    5.16.10. The USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor
    requests (ones with a large array index and ones associated with NULL function pointer
    retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

    An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before
    5.16.10. The RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command.
    Attackers can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

  description: |
    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.8. arch/x86/kvm/svm/svm.c allows a
    set_memory_region_test infinite loop for certain nested page faults, aka CID-e72436bc3a52.

    Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R)
    Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via
    local access.

    Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(R) Processors
    may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local
    access.

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in rtsx_usb_ms_drv_remove in
    drivers/memstick/host/rtsx_usb_ms.c in memstick in the Linux kernel. In this flaw, a local
    attacker with a user privilege may impact system Confidentiality. This flaw affects kernel
    versions prior to 5.14 rc1.

    A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel’s cgroup_release_agent_write in the
    kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use
    of the cgroups v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace
    isolation unexpectedly.

    A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was
    found in the way user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A
    local user could use this flaw to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till
    5.17-rc2.

    net/netfilter/nf_dup_netdev.c in the Linux kernel 5.4 through 5.6.10 allows local users to
    gain privileges because of a heap out-of-bounds write. This is related to
    nf_tables_offload.

    In the Linux kernel through 5.15.2, mwifiex_usb_recv in
    drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/usb.c allows an attacker (who can connect a crafted
    USB device) to cause a denial of service (skb_over_panic).

    A random memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's GPU i915 kernel driver
    functionality in the way a user may run malicious code on the GPU. This flaw allows a
    local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.

    A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the
    way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes
    is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or
    possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network.

    A vulnerability was found in kvm_s390_guest_sida_op in the arch/s390/kvm/kvm-s390.c
    function in KVM for s390 in the Linux kernel. This flaw allows a local attacker with a
    normal user privilege to obtain unauthorized memory write access. This flaw affects Linux
    kernel versions prior to 5.17-rc4.

    A flaw was found in the way the "flags" member of the new pipe buffer structure was
    lacking proper initialization in copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions in the
    Linux kernel and could thus contain stale values. An unprivileged local user could use
    this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read only files and as such
    escalate their privileges on the system.

    An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an
    application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open()
    performs a regular lookup. If a regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the
    server instead returns uninitialized data in the file descriptor.

    An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. There is a memory leak in
    yam_siocdevprivate in drivers/net/hamradio/yam.c.

    An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/composite.c in the Linux kernel before
    5.16.10. The USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain validation of interface OS descriptor
    requests (ones with a large array index and ones associated with NULL function pointer
    retrieval). Memory corruption might occur.

    An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before
    5.16.10. The RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command.
    Attackers can obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

    containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. A bug was
    found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.14.12 where containers launched
    through containerd’s CRI implementation on Linux with a specially-crafted image
    configuration could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on
    the host. This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a
    Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes
    and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has
    been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions
    to resolve the issue.

    In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.33, 7.4.x below 7.4.26 and 8.0.x below 8.0.13, certain XML
    parsing functions, like simplexml_load_file(), URL-decode the filename passed to them. If
    that filename contains URL-encoded NUL character, this may cause the function to interpret
    this as the end of the filename, thus interpreting the filename differently from what the
    user intended, which may lead it to reading a different file than intended.

    In PHP versions 7.4.x below 7.4.28, 8.0.x below 8.0.16, and 8.1.x below 8.1.3, when using
    filter functions with FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT filter and min/max limits, if the filter
    fails, there is a possibility to trigger use of allocated memory after free, which can
    result it crashes, and potentially in overwrite of other memory chunks and RCE. This issue
    affects: code that uses FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT with min/max limits.

  description: |
    The org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection method of the H2 database takes as parameters the
    class name of the driver and URL of the database. An attacker may pass a JNDI driver name
    and a URL leading to a LDAP or RMI servers, causing remote code execution. This can be
    exploited through various attack vectors, most notably through the H2 Console which leads
    to unauthenticated remote code execution.

    H2 Console before 2.1.210 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
    jdbc:h2:mem JDBC URL containing the
    IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SETTINGS=TRUE;FORBID_CREATION=FALSE;INIT=RUNSCRIPT substring, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2021-42392.

    If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have
    auto-updated itself and while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the
    new requested permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6,
    and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the
    resulting object could have been changed into an executable script which would have run
    arbitrary code after the user clicked on it. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97,
    Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    If a document created a sandboxed iframe without <code>allow-scripts</code>, and
    subsequently appended an element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event
    handler - the event handler would have run despite the iframe's sandbox. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the
    difference between <code>application/javascript</code> responses and non-script responses.
    This could have been abused to learn information cross-origin. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly
    enforcing the frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension's Content
    Security Policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox
    ESR < 91.6.

    When a worker is shutdown, it was possible to cause script to run late in the lifecycle,
    at a point after where it should not be possible. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 96,
    Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    Mozilla developers Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs
    present in Firefox 96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
    to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    If a user installed an extension of a particular type, the extension could have
    auto-updated itself and while doing so, bypass the prompt which grants the new version the
    new requested permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6,
    and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    If a user was convinced to drag and drop an image to their desktop or other folder, the
    resulting object could have been changed into an executable script which would have run
    arbitrary code after the user clicked on it. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97,
    Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    If a document created a sandboxed iframe without <code>allow-scripts</code>, and
    subsequently appended an element to the iframe's document that e.g. had a JavaScript event
    handler - the event handler would have run despite the iframe's sandbox. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages would distinguish the
    difference between <code>application/javascript</code> responses and non-script responses.
    This could have been abused to learn information cross-origin. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    Web-accessible extension pages (pages with a moz-extension:// scheme) were not correctly
    enforcing the frame-ancestors directive when it was used in the Web Extension's Content
    Security Policy. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox
    ESR < 91.6.

    When a worker is shutdown, it was possible to cause script to run late in the lifecycle,
    at a point after where it should not be possible. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 96,
    Thunderbird < 91.6, and Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    Mozilla developers Paul Adenot and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs
    present in Firefox 96 and Firefox ESR 91.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
    to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 97, Thunderbird < 91.6, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.6.

    The REXML gem before 3.2.5 in Ruby before 2.6.7, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, and 3.x before 3.0.1
    does not properly address XML round-trip issues. An incorrect document can be produced
    after parsing and serializing.

    In RDoc 3.11 through 6.x before 6.3.1, as distributed with Ruby through 3.0.1, it is
    possible to execute arbitrary code via | and tags in a filename.

    An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1.
    A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to
    a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about
    services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port
    scans and service banner extractions).

    An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1.
    Net::IMAP does not raise an exception when StartTLS fails with an an unknown response,
    which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the TLS protections by leveraging
    a network position between the client and the registry to block the StartTLS command, aka
    a "StartTLS stripping attack."

    Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial
    of Service) via a long string. The fixed versions are 3.2.1, 3.1.2, 3.0.2, and 2.0.1.

    CGI::Cookie.parse in Ruby through 2.6.8 mishandles security prefixes in cookie names. This
    also affects the CGI gem through 0.3.0 for Ruby.

    A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The
    pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands
    as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't
    handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment
    variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in
    such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the
    attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative
    rights on the target machine.

  description: |
    Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. Prior to versions
    1.12.3 and 1.10.6, Flatpak doesn't properly validate that the permissions displayed to the
    user for an app at install time match the actual permissions granted to the app at
    runtime, in the case that there's a null byte in the metadata file of an app. Therefore
    apps can grant themselves permissions without the consent of the user. Flatpak shows
    permissions to the user during install by reading them from the "xa.metadata" key in the
    commit metadata. This cannot contain a null terminator, because it is an untrusted
    GVariant. Flatpak compares these permissions to the *actual* metadata, from the "metadata"
    file to ensure it wasn't lied to. However, the actual metadata contents are loaded in
    several places where they are read as simple C-style strings. That means that, if the
    metadata file includes a null terminator, only the content of the file from *before* the
    terminator gets compared to xa.metadata. Thus, any permissions that appear in the metadata
    file after a null terminator are applied at runtime but not shown to the user. So
    maliciously crafted apps can give themselves hidden permissions. Users who have Flatpaks
    installed from untrusted sources are at risk in case the Flatpak has a maliciously crafted
    metadata file, either initially or in an update. This issue is patched in versions 1.12.3
    and 1.10.6. As a workaround, users can manually check the permissions of installed apps by
    checking the metadata file or the xa.metadata key on the commit metadata.

    Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. A path traversal
    vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder
    applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the
    full access that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will
    gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem. However,
    if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak
    build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which
    can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only
    issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write
    permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary
    and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and
    1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.

    It was possible to construct specific XSLT markup that would be able to bypass an iframe
    sandbox. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird <
    91.5.

    Constructing audio sinks could have lead to a race condition when playing audio files and
    closing windows. This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and
    Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Applying a CSS filter effect could have accessed out of bounds memory. This could have
    lead to a heap-buffer-overflow causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Malicious websites could have tricked users into accepting launching a program to handle
    an external URL protocol. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and
    Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Certain network request objects were freed too early when releasing a network request
    handle. This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    When resizing a popup while requesting fullscreen access, the popup would have become
    unable to leave fullscreen mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox <
    96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    When inserting text while in edit mode, some characters might have lead to out-of-bounds
    memory access causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    When navigating from inside an iframe while requesting fullscreen access, an
    attacker-controlled tab could have made the browser unable to leave fullscreen mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Securitypolicyviolation events could have leaked cross-origin information for
    frame-ancestors violations. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96,
    and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    After accepting an untrusted certificate, handling an empty pkcs7 sequence as part of the
    certificate data could have lead to a crash. This crash is believed to be unexploitable.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Malicious websites could have confused Firefox into showing the wrong origin when asking
    to launch a program and handling an external URL protocol. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Mozilla developers Calixte Denizet, Kershaw Chang, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer,
    Gabriele Svelto, Tyson Smith, Simon Giesecke, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs
    present in Firefox 95 and Firefox ESR 91.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
    to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and
    Thunderbird < 91.5.

  description: |
    It was possible to construct specific XSLT markup that would be able to bypass an iframe
    sandbox. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird <
    91.5.

    Constructing audio sinks could have lead to a race condition when playing audio files and
    closing windows. This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and
    Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Applying a CSS filter effect could have accessed out of bounds memory. This could have
    lead to a heap-buffer-overflow causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Malicious websites could have tricked users into accepting launching a program to handle
    an external URL protocol. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and
    Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Certain network request objects were freed too early when releasing a network request
    handle. This could have lead to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    When resizing a popup while requesting fullscreen access, the popup would have become
    unable to leave fullscreen mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox <
    96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    When inserting text while in edit mode, some characters might have lead to out-of-bounds
    memory access causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    When navigating from inside an iframe while requesting fullscreen access, an
    attacker-controlled tab could have made the browser unable to leave fullscreen mode. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Securitypolicyviolation events could have leaked cross-origin information for
    frame-ancestors violations. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96,
    and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    After accepting an untrusted certificate, handling an empty pkcs7 sequence as part of the
    certificate data could have lead to a crash. This crash is believed to be unexploitable.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Malicious websites could have confused Firefox into showing the wrong origin when asking
    to launch a program and handling an external URL protocol. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and Thunderbird < 91.5.

    Mozilla developers Calixte Denizet, Kershaw Chang, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer,
    Gabriele Svelto, Tyson Smith, Simon Giesecke, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs
    present in Firefox 95 and Firefox ESR 91.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
    to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.5, Firefox < 96, and
    Thunderbird < 91.5.

  description: |
    Any CA issuer in the RPKI can trick OctoRPKI prior to 1.3.0 into emitting an invalid VRP
    "MaxLength" value, causing RTR sessions to terminate. An attacker can use this to disable
    RPKI Origin Validation in a victim network (for example AS 13335 - Cloudflare) prior to
    launching a BGP hijack which during normal operations would be rejected as "RPKI invalid".
    Additionally, in certain deployments RTR session flapping in and of itself also could
    cause BGP routing churn, causing availability issues.

    OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing "..", this allows a repository
    to create a file, (ex. rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa), which
    would then be written to disk outside the base cache folder. This could allow for remote
    code execution on the host machine OctoRPKI is running on.

    OctoRPKI does not limit the depth of a certificate chain, allowing for a CA to create
    children in an ad-hoc fashion, thereby making tree traversal never end.

    OctoRPKI does not limit the length of a connection, allowing for a slowloris DOS attack to
    take place which makes OctoRPKI wait forever. Specifically, the repository that OctoRPKI
    sends HTTP requests to will keep the connection open for a day before a response is
    returned, but does keep drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection alive.

    OctoRPKI crashes when encountering a repository that returns an invalid ROA (just an
    encoded NUL (\0) character).

    If the ROA that a repository returns contains too many bits for the IP address then
    OctoRPKI will crash.

    OctoRPKI tries to load the entire contents of a repository in memory, and in the case of a
    GZIP bomb, unzip it in memory, making it possible to create a repository that makes
    OctoRPKI run out of memory (and thus crash).

    In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by
    an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection
    alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a
    configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to
    individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP
    repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously
    extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue
    once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to
    stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial
    validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.

    NLnet Labs Routinator versions 0.9.0 up to and including 0.10.1, support the gzip transfer
    encoding when querying RRDP repositories. This encoding can be used by an RRDP repository
    to cause an out-of-memory crash in these versions of Routinator. RRDP uses XML which
    allows arbitrary amounts of white space in the encoded data. The gzip scheme compresses
    such white space extremely well, leading to very small compressed files that become huge
    when being decompressed for further processing, big enough that Routinator runs out of
    memory when parsing input data waiting for the next XML element.

  description: |
    A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a
    crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy
    declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket
    endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery). This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to
    2.4.51 (included).

    A carefully crafted request body can cause a buffer overflow in the mod_lua multipart
    parser (r:parsebody() called from Lua scripts). The Apache httpd team is not aware of an
    exploit for the vulnerabilty though it might be possible to craft one. This issue affects
    Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and earlier.

  description: |
    When receiving an OpenPGP/MIME signed email message that contains an additional outer MIME
    message layer, for example a message footer added by a mailing list gateway, Thunderbird
    only considered the inner signed message for the signature validity. This gave the false
    impression that the additional contents were also covered by the digital signature.
    Starting with Thunderbird version 91.4.1, only the signature that belongs to the top level
    MIME part will be considered for the displayed status. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.4.1.

    Mozilla developers and community members Julian Hector, Randell Jesup, Gabriele Svelto,
    Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, and Masayuki Nakano reported memory safety bugs present in
    Firefox 94. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
    with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 95, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Thunderbird < 91.4.0.

    During operations on MessageTasks, a task may have been removed while it was still
    scheduled, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.15, Thunderbird < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 91.2, Firefox
    ESR < 78.15, and Firefox < 93.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 92 and Firefox ESR 91.1.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 78.15, Thunderbird < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 78.15,
    and Firefox < 93.

    Thunderbird ignored the configuration to require STARTTLS security for an SMTP connection.
    A MITM could perform a downgrade attack to intercept transmitted messages, or could take
    control of the authenticated session to execute SMTP commands chosen by the MITM. If an
    unprotected authentication method was configured, the MITM could obtain the authentication
    credentials, too. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.2.

    The iframe sandbox rules were not correctly applied to XSLT stylesheets, allowing an
    iframe to bypass restrictions such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    When interacting with an HTML input element's file picker dialog with webkitdirectory set,
    a use-after-free could have resulted, leading to memory corruption and a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    Through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered fullscreen mode without
    notification or warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI
    including phishing. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be
    transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection,
    including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second
    encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic
    encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to
    port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP.
    This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    By displaying a form validity message in the correct location at the same time as a
    permission prompt (such as for geolocation), the validity message could have obscured the
    prompt, resulting in the user potentially being tricked into granting the permission. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    Due to an unusual sequence of attacker-controlled events, a Javascript alert() dialog with
    arbitrary (although unstyled) contents could be displayed over top an uncontrolled webpage
    of the attacker's choosing. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3,
    and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    Thunderbird unexpectedly enabled JavaScript in the composition area. The JavaScript
    execution context was limited to this area and did not receive chrome-level privileges,
    but could be used as a stepping stone to further an attack with other vulnerabilities.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0.

    Thunderbird versions prior to 91.3.0 are vulnerable to the heap overflow described in
    CVE-2021-43527 when processing S/MIME messages. Thunderbird versions 91.3.0 and later will
    not call the vulnerable code when processing S/MIME messages that contain certificates
    with DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93
    and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    A use-after-free could have occured when an HTTP2 session object was released on a
    different thread, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 93, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    Under certain circumstances, asynchronous functions could have caused a navigation to fail
    but expose the target URL. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR <
    91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    An incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers allowed an attacker to
    corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    By misusing a race in our notification code, an attacker could have forcefully hidden the
    notification for pages that had received full screen and pointer lock access, which could
    have been used for spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0,
    Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Failure to correctly record the location of live pointers across wasm instance calls
    resulted in a GC occurring within the call not tracing those live pointers. This could
    have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    When invoking protocol handlers for external protocols, a supplied parameter URL
    containing spaces was not properly escaped. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Using XMLHttpRequest, an attacker could have identified installed applications by probing
    error messages for loading external protocols. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Documents loaded with the CSP sandbox directive could have escaped the sandbox's script
    restriction by embedding additional content. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Using the Location API in a loop could have caused severe application hangs and crashes.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    It was possible to recreate previous cursor spoofing attacks against users with a zoomed
    native cursor. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and
    Firefox < 95.

    The olm_session_describe function in Matrix libolm before 3.2.7 is vulnerable to a buffer
    overflow. The Olm session object represents a cryptographic channel between two parties.
    Therefore, its state is partially controllable by the remote party of the channel.
    Attackers can construct a crafted sequence of messages to manipulate the state of the
    receiver's session in such a way that, for some buffer sizes, a buffer overflow happens on
    a call to olm_session_describe. Furthermore, safe buffer sizes were undocumented. The
    overflow content is partially controllable by the attacker and limited to ASCII spaces and
    digits. The known affected products are Element Web And SchildiChat Web.

  description: |
    OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing "..", this allows a repository
    to create a file, (ex. rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa), which
    would then be written to disk outside the base cache folder. This could allow for remote
    code execution on the host machine OctoRPKI is running on.

    OctoRPKI does not limit the length of a connection, allowing for a slowloris DOS attack to
    take place which makes OctoRPKI wait forever. Specifically, the repository that OctoRPKI
    sends HTTP requests to will keep the connection open for a day before a response is
    returned, but does keep drip feeding new bytes to keep the connection alive.

    In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be delayed significantly by
    an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection
    alive. This can be used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a
    configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to
    individual read or write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP
    repository sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously
    extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only continue
    once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this delay will cause validation to
    stall, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial
    validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.

    FORT Validator versions prior to 1.5.2 will crash if an RPKI CA publishes an X.509 EE
    certificate. This will lead to RTR clients such as BGP routers to lose access to the RPKI
    VRP data set, effectively disabling Route Origin Validation.

    In DjVuLibre 3.5.27, DjVmDir.cpp in the DJVU reader component allows attackers to cause a
    denial-of-service (application crash in GStringRep::strdup in libdjvu/GString.cpp caused
    by a heap-based buffer over-read) by crafting a DJVU file.

    In DjVuLibre 3.5.27, the bitmap reader component allows attackers to cause a
    denial-of-service error (resource exhaustion caused by a GBitmap::read_rle_raw infinite
    loop) by crafting a corrupted image file, related to libdjvu/DjVmDir.cpp and
    libdjvu/GBitmap.cpp.

    In DjVuLibre 3.5.27, the sorting functionality (aka GArrayTemplate<TYPE>::sort) allows
    attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash due to an Uncontrolled
    Recursion) by crafting a PBM image file that is mishandled in libdjvu/GContainer.h.

    DjVuLibre 3.5.27 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service attack (application crash
    via an out-of-bounds read) by crafting a corrupted JB2 image file that is mishandled in
    JB2Dict::JB2Codec::get_direct_context in libdjvu/JB2Image.h because of a missing
    zero-bytes check in libdjvu/GBitmap.h.

    SPIP 4.0.0 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. To exploit the
    vulnerability, a visitor must browse to a malicious SVG file. The vulnerability allows an
    authenticated attacker to inject malicious code running on the client side into web pages
    visited by other users (stored XSS).

    SPIP 4.0.0 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
    ecrire/public/interfaces.php, adding the function safehtml to the vulnerable fields. An
    editor is able to modify his personal information. If the editor has an article written
    and available, when a user goes to the public site and wants to read the author's
    information, the malicious code will be executed. The "Who are you" and "Website Name"
    fields are vulnerable.

    SPIP 4.0.0 is affected by a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
    ecrire/public/aiguiller.php, ecrire/public/balises.php, ecrire/balise/formulaire_.php. To
    exploit the vulnerability, a visitor must visit a malicious website which redirects to the
    SPIP website. It is also possible to combine XSS vulnerabilities in SPIP 4.0.0 to exploit
    it. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute malicious code without
    the knowledge of the user on the website (CSRF).

    SPIP 4.0.0 is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability. To exploit the
    vulnerability, an attacker must craft a malicious picture with a double extension, upload
    it and then click on it to execute it.

  description: |
    Mozilla developers and community members Julian Hector, Randell Jesup, Gabriele Svelto,
    Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, and Masayuki Nakano reported memory safety bugs present in
    Firefox 94. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
    with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 95, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Thunderbird < 91.4.0.

    It was possible to recreate previous cursor spoofing attacks against users with a zoomed
    native cursor. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and
    Firefox < 95.

    Using the Location API in a loop could have caused severe application hangs and crashes.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Documents loaded with the CSP sandbox directive could have escaped the sandbox's script
    restriction by embedding additional content. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Using XMLHttpRequest, an attacker could have identified installed applications by probing
    error messages for loading external protocols. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    When invoking protocol handlers for external protocols, a supplied parameter URL
    containing spaces was not properly escaped. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Failure to correctly record the location of live pointers across wasm instance calls
    resulted in a GC occurring within the call not tracing those live pointers. This could
    have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    By misusing a race in our notification code, an attacker could have forcefully hidden the
    notification for pages that had received full screen and pointer lock access, which could
    have been used for spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0,
    Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    An incorrect type conversion of sizes from 64bit to 32bit integers allowed an attacker to
    corrupt memory leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR < 91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    Under certain circumstances, asynchronous functions could have caused a navigation to fail
    but expose the target URL. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.4.0, Firefox ESR <
    91.4.0, and Firefox < 95.

    A use-after-free could have occured when an HTTP2 session object was released on a
    different thread, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 93, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93
    and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    Due to an unusual sequence of attacker-controlled events, a Javascript alert() dialog with
    arbitrary (although unstyled) contents could be displayed over top an uncontrolled webpage
    of the attacker's choosing. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3,
    and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    By displaying a form validity message in the correct location at the same time as a
    permission prompt (such as for geolocation), the validity message could have obscured the
    prompt, resulting in the user potentially being tricked into granting the permission. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be
    transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection,
    including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second
    encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic
    encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to
    port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP.
    This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    Through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered fullscreen mode without
    notification or warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI
    including phishing. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    When interacting with an HTML input element's file picker dialog with webkitdirectory set,
    a use-after-free could have resulted, leading to memory corruption and a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and
    Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    The iframe sandbox rules were not correctly applied to XSLT stylesheets, allowing an
    iframe to bypass restrictions such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

    in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over
    Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default
    Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread
    Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup
    pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments
    and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7)
    fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI
    functionality by default.

    PCI devices with RMRRs not deassigned correctly Certain PCI devices in a system might be
    assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR").
    These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation. If such a device
    is passed through to a guest, then on guest shutdown the device is not properly
    deassigned. The IOMMU configuration for these devices which are not properly deassigned
    ends up pointing to a freed data structure, including the IO Pagetables. Subsequent DMA or
    interrupts from the device will have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to
    memory corruption.

    PoD operations on misaligned GFNs T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs;
    the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH
    guests may be started in populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, to provide a way for them to later
    easily have more memory assigned. Guests are permitted to control certain P2M aspects of
    individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercalls may act on ranges of pages specified via
    page orders (resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). The implementation of some of
    these hypercalls for PoD does not enforce the base page frame number to be suitably
    aligned for the specified order, yet some code involved in PoD handling actually makes
    such an assumption. These operations are XENMEM_decrease_reservation (CVE-2021-28704) and
    XENMEM_populate_physmap (CVE-2021-28707), the latter usable only by domains controlling
    the guest, i.e. a de-privileged qemu or a stub domain. (Patch 1, combining the fix to both
    these two issues.) In addition handling of XENMEM_decrease_reservation can also trigger a
    host crash when the specified page order is neither 4k nor 2M nor 1G (CVE-2021-28708,
    patch 2).

    issues with partially successful P2M updates on x86 T[his CNA information record relates
    to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which
    CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH guests may be started in populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, to provide a
    way for them to later easily have more memory assigned. Guests are permitted to control
    certain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercalls may act on ranges
    of pages specified via page orders (resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). In some
    cases the hypervisor carries out the requests by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error
    handling in certain PoD cases has been insufficient in that in particular partial success
    of some operations was not properly accounted for. There are two code paths affected -
    page removal (CVE-2021-28705) and insertion of new pages (CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one
    patch which combines the fix to both issues.)

    guests may exceed their designated memory limit When a guest is permitted to have close to
    16TiB of memory, it may be able to issue hypercalls to increase its memory allocation
    beyond the administrator established limit. This is a result of a calculation done with
    32-bit precision, which may overflow. It would then only be the overflowed (and hence
    small) number which gets compared against the established upper bound.

    these hypercalls for PoD does not enforce the base page frame number to be suitably
    aligned for the specified order, yet some code involved in PoD handling actually makes
    such an assumption. These operations are XENMEM_decrease_reservation (CVE-2021-28704) and
    XENMEM_populate_physmap (CVE-2021-28707), the latter usable only by domains controlling
    the guest, i.e. a de-privileged qemu or a stub domain. (Patch 1, combining the fix to both
    these two issues.) In addition handling of XENMEM_decrease_reservation can also trigger a
    host crash when the specified page order is neither 4k nor 2M nor 1G (CVE-2021-28708,
    patch 2).

    certain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercalls may act on ranges
    of pages specified via page orders (resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). In some
    cases the hypervisor carries out the requests by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error
    handling in certain PoD cases has been insufficient in that in particular partial success
    of some operations was not properly accounted for. There are two code paths affected -
    page removal (CVE-2021-28705) and insertion of new pages (CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one
    patch which combines the fix to both issues.)

    NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR are vulnerable to a
    heap overflow when handling DER-encoded DSA or RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS
    for handling signatures encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely to
    be impacted. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other TLS, X.509, OCSP
    or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on how they configure NSS. *Note: This
    vulnerability does NOT impact Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and PDF viewers
    that use NSS for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice, Evolution and
    Evince are believed to be impacted. This vulnerability affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS <
    3.68.1.

    The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an
    arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar
    aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not
    extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not
    symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a
    given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was
    insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with
    the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry
    used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
    `\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\` is a valid filename character on
    posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a
    symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories,
    essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and
    subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file
    creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
    filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link
    named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link
    would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory
    cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO`
    directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the
    directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8
    and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for
    these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent
    version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced
    GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.

    The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an

    aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not
    extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not
    symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a
    given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was
    insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with
    names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on
    Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as
    their 8.3 "short path" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a
    directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string
    that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By
    first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a
    different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus
    possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an
    untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting
    arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.
    These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of
    node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are

    A flaw was found in the way samba implemented SMB1 authentication. An attacker could use
    this flaw to retrieve the plaintext password sent over the wire even if Kerberos
    authentication was required.

    A flaw was found in the way Samba maps domain users to local users. An authenticated
    attacker could use this flaw to cause possible privilege escalation.

    A flaw was found in the way samba, as an Active Directory Domain Controller, is able to
    support an RODC (read-only domain controller). This would allow an RODC to print
    administrator tickets.

    A flaw was found in the way Samba, as an Active Directory Domain Controller, implemented
    Kerberos name-based authentication. The Samba AD DC, could become confused about the user
    a ticket represents if it did not strictly require a Kerberos PAC and always use the SIDs
    found within. The result could include total domain compromise.

    Kerberos acceptors need easy access to stable AD identifiers (eg objectSid). Samba as an
    AD DC now provides a way for Linux applications to obtain a reliable SID (and
    samAccountName) in issued tickets.

    Multiple flaws were found in the way samba AD DC implemented access and conformance
    checking of stored data. An attacker could use this flaw to cause total domain compromise.

    In DCE/RPC it is possible to share the handles (cookies for resource state) between
    multiple connections via a mechanism called 'association groups'. These handles can
    reference connections to our sam.ldb database. However while the database was correctly
    shared, the user credentials state was only pointed at, and when one connection within
    that association group ended, the database would be left pointing at an invalid 'struct
    session_info'. The most likely outcome here is a crash, but it is possible that the
    use-after-free could instead allow different user state to be pointed at and this might
    allow more privileged access.

    A flaw was found in the way samba implemented DCE/RPC. If a client to a Samba server sent
    a very large DCE/RPC request, and chose to fragment it, an attacker could replace later
    fragments with their own data, bypassing the signature requirements.

    containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness
    and portability. A bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some
    plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux
    users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included
    executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux
    users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux
    user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the
    unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This
    vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should
    update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update
    directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update should limit
    access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles
    directories.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions
    specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can cause the heap-based Lua stack to be
    overflowed, due to incomplete checks for this condition. This can result with heap
    corruption and potentially remote code execution. This problem exists in all versions of
    Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is fixed in versions
    6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update an additional workaround to mitigate
    the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from
    executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In affected versions an
    integer overflow bug in Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result
    with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default
    proto-max-bulk-len and client-query-buffer-limit configuration parameters to very large
    values and constructing specially crafted very large stream elements. The problem is fixed
    in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to upgrade an additional workaround to
    mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from
    modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to
    restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug
    in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt
    the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves
    modifying the default ziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-ziplist-entries,
    hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries or zset-max-ziplist-value) to a very
    large value, and then constructing specially crafted commands to create very large
    ziplists. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional
    workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to
    prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using
    ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When using the Redis
    Lua Debugger, users can send malformed requests that cause the debugger’s protocol parser
    to read data beyond the actual buffer. This issue affects all versions of Redis with Lua
    debugging support (3.2 or newer). The problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and
    5.0.14.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. When parsing an
    incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request, Redis allocates memory according to
    user-specified values which determine the number of elements (in the multi-bulk header)
    and size of each element (in the bulk header). An attacker delivering specially crafted
    requests over multiple connections can cause the server to allocate significant amount of
    memory. Because the same parsing mechanism is used to handle authentication requests, this
    vulnerability can also be exploited by unauthenticated users. The problem is fixed in
    Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem
    without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated
    users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways: Using network access
    control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc. or Enabling TLS and
    requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug
    affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially be
    used to leak arbitrary contents of the heap or trigger remote code execution. The
    vulnerability involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter
    to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands to manipulate sets. The
    problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to
    mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from
    modifying the set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL
    to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. The redis-cli command
    line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing
    specially crafted large multi-bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in
    the underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the
    calloc() heap allocation function. This issue only impacts systems with heap allocators
    that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore
    not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc
    allocator which is also not vulnerable. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6,
    6.0.16 and 5.0.14.

    Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug
    in the underlying string library can be used to corrupt the heap and potentially result
    with denial of service or remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the
    default proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing
    specially crafted network payloads or commands. The problem is fixed in Redis versions
    6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without
    patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the
    proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict
    unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

    before 17.9.4, and 18.x before 18.5.1, and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert10. If the
    IAX2 channel driver receives a packet that contains an unsupported media format, a crash
    can occur.

    PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language
    implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP
    before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race
    condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock.
    Second, the SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues
    were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash,
    resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version 2.11.1.

    FFmpeg 4.2 is affected by a Divide By Zero issue via libavcodec/aacpsy.c, which allows a
    remote malicious user to cause a Denial of Service.

    FFmpeg 4.2 is affected by null pointer dereference passed as argument to
    libavformat/aviobuf.c, which could cause a Denial of Service.

    FFmpeg 4.2 is affected by a Divide By Zero issue via libavcodec/aaccoder, which allows a
    remote malicious user to cause a Denial of Service

    A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 due to a memory leak in
    avcodec_alloc_context3 at options.c.

    A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 due to a memory leak is affected
    by: memory leak in the link_filter_inouts function in libavfilter/graphparser.c.

    libavcodec/dnxhddec.c in FFmpeg 4.4 does not check the return value of the init_vlc
    function, a similar issue to CVE-2013-0868.

    adts_decode_extradata in libavformat/adtsenc.c in FFmpeg 4.4 does not check the
    init_get_bits return value, which is a necessary step because the second argument to
    init_get_bits can be crafted.

    FFmpeg version (git commit de8e6e67e7523e48bb27ac224a0b446df05e1640) suffers from a an
    assertion failure at src/libavutil/mathematics.c.

    A heap-use-after-free in the mpeg_mux_write_packet function in libavformat/mpegenc.c of
    FFmpeg 4.2 allows to cause a denial of service (DOS) via a crafted avi file.

    A heap-use-after-free in the av_freep function in libavutil/mem.c of FFmpeg 4.2 allows
    attackers to execute arbitrary code.

    FFmpeg 4.2 is affected by a Divide By Zero issue via libavcodec/lpc.h, which allows a
    remote malicious user to cause a Denial of Service.

    BubblewrapLauncher.cpp in WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1 allows a limited sandbox
    bypass that allows a sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the sandboxed
    process is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS syscalls that manipulate its
    filesystem namespace. The impact is limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that
    WebKit mounts inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise confined.
    NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.

    In WebKitGTK before 2.32.4, there is incorrect memory allocation in
    WebCore::ImageBufferCairoImageSurfaceBackend::create, leading to a segmentation violation
    and application crash, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-30889.

    content may lead to code execution.

    The issue was resolved with additional restrictions on CSS compositing. This issue is
    fixed in tvOS 15, watchOS 8, iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Visiting a maliciously crafted website
    may reveal a user's browsing history.

    An information leakage issue was addressed. This issue is fixed in iOS 15.1 and iPadOS
    15.1, macOS Monterey 12.0.1, iOS 14.8.1 and iPadOS 14.8.1, tvOS 15.1, watchOS 8.1. A
    malicious website using Content Security Policy reports may be able to leak information
    via redirect behavior .

    A buffer overflow issue was addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed
    in macOS Monterey 12.0.1, iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1, watchOS 8.1, tvOS 15.1. Processing
    maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.

    BubblewrapLauncher.cpp in WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1 allows a limited sandbox
    bypass that allows a sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the sandboxed
    process is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS syscalls that manipulate its
    filesystem namespace. The impact is limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that
    WebKit mounts inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise confined.
    NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.

    In WebKitGTK before 2.32.4, there is incorrect memory allocation in
    WebCore::ImageBufferCairoImageSurfaceBackend::create, leading to a segmentation violation
    and application crash, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-30889.

    In WebKitGTK before 2.32.4, there is a use-after-free in WebCore::Frame::page, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2021-30889.

    In BIND 9.3.0 -> 9.11.35, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.21, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.35-S1 and
    9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.21-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions
    9.17.0 -> 9.17.18 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, exploitation of broken
    authoritative servers using a flaw in response processing can cause degradation in BIND
    resolver performance. The way the lame cache is currently designed makes it possible for
    its internal data structures to grow almost infinitely, which may cause significant delays
    in client query processing.

    /options/mailman in GNU Mailman before 2.1.31 allows Arbitrary Content Injection.

    GNU Mailman before 2.1.33 allows arbitrary content injection via the Cgi/private.py
    private archive login page.

    GNU Mailman before 2.1.35 may allow remote Privilege Escalation. A certain csrf_token
    value is derived from the admin password, and may be useful in conducting a brute-force
    attack against that password.

    GNU Mailman before 2.1.35 may allow remote Privilege Escalation. A csrf_token value is not
    specific to a single user account. An attacker can obtain a value within the context of an
    unprivileged user account, and then use that value in a CSRF attack against an admin
    (e.g., for account takeover).

  description: |
    The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow via a crafted
    certificate with an RSASSA-PSS signature. For example, this can be triggered by an
    unrelated self-signed CA certificate sent by an initiator. Remote code execution cannot
    occur.

    The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow
    upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later
    trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used
    cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote
    code execution might be a slight possibility.

    LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents,
    presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing
    and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in
    LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating
    the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to combine
    multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice to display a validly
    signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to the signature shown. This issue
    affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions
    prior to 7.1.2.

    LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents,
    presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing
    and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in
    LibreOffice allowed an attacker to modify a digitally signed ODF document to insert an
    additional signing time timestamp which LibreOffice would incorrectly present as a valid
    signature signed at the bogus signing time. This issue affects: The Document Foundation

    different vulnerability than CVE-2021-40153. A squashfs filesystem that has been crafted
    to include a symbolic link and then contents under the same filename in a filesystem can
    cause unsquashfs to first create the symbolic link pointing outside the expected

    WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired
    with a MySQL or MariaDB database. ### Impact The issue allows an authenticated but
    low-privileged user (like contributor/author) to execute XSS in the editor. This bypasses
    the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post
    `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed
    to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended that
    you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References

    Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications
    on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, Flatpak apps with direct access to
    AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick
    portals and other host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an
    ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating the VFS using
    recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter,
    in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely.
    Flatpak apps that act as clients for AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland,
    Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that the corresponding services
    will believe the Flatpak app has. Note that protocols that operate entirely over the D-Bus
    session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are not affected by this. This is
    due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the
    Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses. Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and
    1.12.0, and as of time of publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned. There
    are no workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.

    Malformed requests may cause the server to dereference a NULL pointer. This issue affects
    Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.

    A carefully crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy_uwsgi to read above the allocated
    memory and crash (DoS). This issue affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.30 to 2.4.48
    (inclusive).

    ap_escape_quotes() may write beyond the end of a buffer when given malicious input. No
    included modules pass untrusted data to these functions, but third-party / external
    modules may. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.

    A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server
    choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.

  description: |
    During operations on MessageTasks, a task may have been removed while it was still
    scheduled, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.15, Thunderbird < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 91.2, Firefox
    ESR < 78.15, and Firefox < 93.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 92 and Firefox ESR 91.1.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 78.15, Thunderbird < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 91.2, Firefox ESR < 78.15,
    and Firefox < 93.

    Several memory leaks were found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device (vhost-user-gpu) of
    QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. They exist in
    contrib/vhost-user-gpu/vhost-user-gpu.c and contrib/vhost-user-gpu/virgl.c due to improper
    release of memory (i.e., free) after effective lifetime.

    An information disclosure vulnerability was found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device
    (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. The flaw exists in
    virgl_cmd_get_capset_info() in contrib/vhost-user-gpu/virgl.c and could occur due to the
    read of uninitialized memory. A malicious guest could exploit this issue to leak memory
    from the host.

    An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device
    (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. The flaw occurs while
    processing the 'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET' command from the guest. It could allow a
    privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
    service condition, or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.

    An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the ATI VGA device emulation of QEMU.
    This flaw occurs in the ati_2d_blt() routine while handling MMIO write operations when the
    guest provides invalid values for the destination display parameters. A malicious guest
    could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
    service.

    A flaw was found in the USB redirector device emulation of QEMU in versions prior to
    6.1.0-rc2. It occurs when dropping packets during a bulk transfer from a SPICE client due
    to the packet queue being full. A malicious SPICE client could use this flaw to make QEMU
    call free() with faked heap chunk metadata, resulting in a crash of QEMU or potential code
    execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

    An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the UAS (USB Attached SCSI) device emulation of
    QEMU in versions prior to 6.2.0-rc0. The device uses the guest supplied stream number
    unchecked, which can lead to out-of-bounds access to the UASDevice->data3 and
    UASDevice->status3 fields. A malicious guest user could use this flaw to crash QEMU or
    potentially achieve code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. It could occur
    when the descriptor's address belongs to the non direct access region, due to num_buffers
    being set after the virtqueue elem has been unmapped. A malicious guest could use this
    flaw to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute
    code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.

    Use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel exploitable by a local attacker due to
    reuse of a DCCP socket with an attached dccps_hc_tx_ccid object as a listener after being
    released. Fixed in Ubuntu Linux kernel 5.4.0-51.56, 5.3.0-68.63, 4.15.0-121.123,
    4.4.0-193.224, 3.13.0.182.191 and 3.2.0-149.196.

    A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw
    occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest
    to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the "int_ctl" field,
    this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt
    Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write
    physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive
    data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to
    5.14-rc7.

    A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw
    occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest
    to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the "virt_ext" field,
    this issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS
    (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to
    read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of
    sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.

    A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior
    to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only
    privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the
    resources causing denial of service.

    A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's OverlayFS subsystem in the way the user mounts the
    TmpFS filesystem with OverlayFS. This flaw allows a local user to gain access to hidden
    files that should not be accessible.

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the btrfs_rm_device function in
    fs/btrfs/volumes.c in the Linux Kernel, where triggering the bug requires ‘CAP_SYS_ADMIN’.
    This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information.
    The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

    An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory read flaw was found in the Qualcomm IPC router protocol in
    the Linux kernel. A missing sanity check allows a local attacker to gain access to
    out-of-bounds memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.
    The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

    A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in the Linux
    kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access to vc_mode is not
    protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
    data confidentiality.

    arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_rtas.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.5 on the powerpc platform
    allows KVM guest OS users to cause host OS memory corruption via rtas_args.nargs, aka
    CID-f62f3c20647e.

    ** DISPUTED ** In drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4, data
    corruption or loss can be triggered by an untrusted device that supplies a buf->len value
    exceeding the buffer size. NOTE: the vendor indicates that the cited data corruption is
    not a vulnerability in any existing use case; the length validation was added solely for
    robustness in the face of anomalous host OS behavior.

    In kernel/bpf/hashtab.c in the Linux kernel through 5.13.8, there is an integer overflow
    and out-of-bounds write when many elements are placed in a single bucket. NOTE:
    exploitation might be impractical without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

    fs/nfs/nfs4client.c in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 has incorrect connection-setup
    ordering, which allows operators of remote NFSv4 servers to cause a denial of service
    (hanging of mounts) by arranging for those servers to be unreachable during trunking
    detection.

    A race condition was discovered in ext4_write_inline_data_end in fs/ext4/inline.c in the
    ext4 subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.13.13.

    loop_rw_iter in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel 5.10 through 5.14.6 allows local users
    to gain privileges by using IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS to trigger a free of a kernel
    buffer, as demonstrated by using /proc/<pid>/maps for exploitation.

    IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs;
    the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and
    Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated,
    which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While
    these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply
    to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to
    prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems,
    where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range
    will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment
    of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing
    a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore
    (CVE-2021-28696).

    grant table v2 status pages may remain accessible after de-allocation Guest get permitted
    access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated /
    associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get
    de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages
    requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The
    hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to
    insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple
    locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page
    that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.

    long running loops in grant table handling In order to properly monitor resource use, Xen
    maintains information on the grant mappings a domain may create to map grants offered by
    other domains. In the process of carrying out certain actions, Xen would iterate over all
    such entries, including ones which aren't in use anymore and some which may have been
    created but never used. If the number of entries for a given domain is large enough, this
    iterating of the entire table may tie up a CPU for too long, starving other domains or
    causing issues in the hypervisor itself. Note that a domain may map its own grants, i.e.
    there is no need for multiple domains to be involved here. A pair of "cooperating" guests
    may, however, cause the effects to be more severe.

    inadequate grant-v2 status frames array bounds check The v2 grant table interface
    separates grant attributes from grant status. That is, when operating in this mode, a
    guest has two tables. As a result, guests also need to be able to retrieve the addresses
    that the new status tracking table can be accessed through. For 32-bit guests on x86,
    translation of requests has to occur because the interface structure layouts commonly
    differ between 32- and 64-bit. The translation of the request to obtain the frame numbers
    of the grant status table involves translating the resulting array of frame numbers. Since
    the space used to carry out the translation is limited, the translation layer tells the
    core function the capacity of the array within translation space. Unfortunately the core
    function then only enforces array bounds to be below 8 times the specified value, and
    would write past the available space if enough frame numbers needed storing.

    xen/arm: No memory limit for dom0less domUs The dom0less feature allows an administrator
    to create multiple unprivileged domains directly from Xen. Unfortunately, the memory limit
    from them is not set. This allow a domain to allocate memory beyond what an administrator
    originally configured.

    Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain
    Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a
    guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when
    a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor
    enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to
    a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were
    freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being
    prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.

    Nextcloud Desktop Client before 3.3.1 is vulnerable to improper certificate validation due
    to lack of SSL certificate verification when using the "Register with a Provider" flow.

    The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a
    computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public
    and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop
    client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public
    certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be
    encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is
    fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from
    upgrading.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 91 and Firefox ESR
    78.13. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
    enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.14, Thunderbird < 78.14, and Firefox < 92.

    A trivial sandbox (enabled with the `-dSAFER` option) escape flaw was found in the
    ghostscript interpreter by injecting a specially crafted pipe command. This flaw allows a
    specially crafted document to execute arbitrary commands on the system in the context of
    the ghostscript interpreter. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
    confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

    In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute is supplied to
    the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for
    memory disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound
    buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause
    is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the "bytes_in_use" field
    should be less than the "bytes_allocated" field. When it is not, the parsing of the
    records proceeds into the wild.

    In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted unicode string is supplied in an
    NTFS image a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for code execution.

    In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when specially crafted NTFS attributes are read in the
    function ntfs_attr_pread_i, a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for writing to
    arbitrary memory or denial of service of the application.

    In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted MFT section is supplied in an
    NTFS image a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for code execution.

    In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS inode pathname is supplied
    in an NTFS image a heap buffer overflow can occur resulting in memory disclosure, denial
    of service and even code execution.

    NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, a stack buffer overflow can occur when correcting
    differences in the MFT and MFTMirror allowing for code execution or escalation of
    privileges when setuid-root.

    In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS inode is loaded in the
    function ntfs_inode_real_open, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for code
    execution and escalation of privileges.

    NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute from the MFT is
    setup in the function ntfs_attr_setup_flag, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for
    code execution and escalation of privileges.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause a NULL pointer dereference in ntfs_extent_inode_open in
    NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_ie_lookup in NTFS-3G <
    2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in ntfs_runlists_merge_i in NTFS-3G <
    2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based
    buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can trigger an out-of-bounds read, caused by an invalid attribute in
    ntfs_attr_find_in_attrdef, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs_inode_lookup_by_name
    in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image with an unallocated bitmap can lead to a endless recursive function
    call chain (starting from ntfs_attr_pwrite), causing stack consumption in NTFS-3G <
    2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause out-of-bounds reads in ntfs_attr_find and
    ntfs_external_attr_find in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can trigger an out-of-bounds access, caused by an unsanitized
    attribute length in ntfs_inode_lookup_by_name, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds access in
    ntfs_inode_sync_standard_information in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in ntfs_compressed_pwrite in
    NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds access in ntfs_decompress in NTFS-3G <
    2021.8.22.

    A crafted NTFS image can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by an unsanitized
    attribute in ntfs_get_attribute_value, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.

    A flaw has been found in libssh in versions prior to 0.9.6. The SSH protocol keeps track
    of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called
    secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key
    re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash.
    Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as
    these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key
    exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating
    "secret_hash" of different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the
    session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key re-exchange.

  description: |
    In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
    EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first
    time, on entry, the "out" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the "outlen" parameter is
    populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application
    can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this
    time passing a non-NULL value for the "out" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the
    SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the
    plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual
    size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when
    EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too
    small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an
    application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of
    62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing
    application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is
    application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected
    1.1.1-1.1.1k).

    ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which
    contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This
    contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which
    is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that
    are parsed using OpenSSL's own "d2i" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as
    well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will
    additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is
    possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not
    NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the "data" and "length" fields in the
    ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
    OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
    byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that
    have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be
    printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly
    constructed by the application without NUL terminating the "data" field, then a read
    buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing
    of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the
    application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate
    contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the
    X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious
    actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it
    through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might
    result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the
    disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2y).

    LedgerSMB does not sufficiently guard against being wrapped by other sites, making it
    vulnerable to 'clickjacking'. This allows an attacker to trick a targetted user to execute
    unintended actions.

    LedgerSMB does not check the origin of HTML fragments merged into the browser's DOM. By
    sending a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user, this flaw can be abused for
    remote code execution and information disclosure.

    LedgerSMB does not sufficiently HTML-encode error messages sent to the browser. By sending

  description: |
    An issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before
    2.4.3. It does not ensure that the scheme and path portions of a URI have the expected
    characters. For example, the authority field (as observed on a target HTTP/2 server) might
    differ from what the routing rules were intended to achieve.

    An issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.0 before 2.0.24, 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before
    2.3.13, and 2.4 before 2.4.3. An HTTP method name may contain a space followed by the name
    of a protected resource. It is possible that a server would interpret this as a request
    for that protected resource, such as in the "GET /admin? HTTP/1.1 /static/images HTTP/1.1"
    example.

    An issue was discovered in HAProxy 2.2 before 2.2.16, 2.3 before 2.3.13, and 2.4 before
    2.4.3. It can lead to a situation with an attacker-controlled HTTP Host header, because a
    mismatch between Host and authority is mishandled.

    Uninitialized memory in a canvas object could have caused an incorrect free() leading to
    memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    Instruction reordering resulted in a sequence of instructions that would cause an object
    to be incorrectly considered during garbage collection. This led to memory corruption and
    a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13,
    Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    A use-after-free vulnerability in media channels could have led to memory corruption and a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird
    < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    A suspected race condition when calling getaddrinfo led to memory corruption and a
    potentially exploitable crash. *Note: This issue only affected Linux operating systems.
    Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13,
    Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in
    an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and
    Firefox < 91.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 90 and Firefox ESR
    78.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
    enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    In Jp2Image::readMetadata() in jp2image.cpp in Exiv2 0.27.2, an input file can result in
    an infinite loop and hang, with high CPU consumption. Remote attackers could leverage this
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.

    A flaw was found in Exiv2 in versions before and including 0.27.4-RC1. Improper input
    validation of the rawData.size property in Jp2Image::readMetadata() in jp2image.cpp can
    lead to a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted JPG image containing malicious EXIF
    data.

    Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and
    modifying the metadata of image files. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions
    v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata
    into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain
    code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.
    Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less
    frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the
    bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument
    such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.

    Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif,
    IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions
    v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
    deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered
    when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could
    potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if
    they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug
    is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2
    operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2
    command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`.
    The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Please see our security policy for information about
    Exiv2 security.

    An integer overflow in CrwMap::encode0x1810 of Exiv2 0.27.3 allows attackers to trigger a
    heap-based buffer overflow and cause a denial of service (DOS) via crafted metadata.

  description: |
    Uninitialized memory in a canvas object could have caused an incorrect free() leading to
    memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    Instruction reordering resulted in a sequence of instructions that would cause an object
    to be incorrectly considered during garbage collection. This led to memory corruption and
    a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13,
    Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    A use-after-free vulnerability in media channels could have led to memory corruption and a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird
    < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    A suspected race condition when calling getaddrinfo led to memory corruption and a
    potentially exploitable crash. *Note: This issue only affected Linux operating systems.
    Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13,
    Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in
    an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Thunderbird < 91, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and
    Firefox < 91.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 90 and Firefox ESR
    78.12. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
    enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.13, Firefox ESR < 78.13, and Firefox < 91.

    Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.66 did not
    correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request header in some circumstances leading to
    the possibility to request smuggling when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: -
    Tomcat incorrectly ignored the transfer encoding header if the client declared it would
    only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; - Tomcat honoured the identify encoding; and - Tomcat
    did not ensure that, if present, the chunked encoding was the final encoding.

    Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through 5.2 may
    permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing (in
    the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the
    authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to
    complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for
    the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a
    time.

    In BlueZ before 5.55, a double free was found in the gatttool disconnect_cb() routine from
    shared/att.c. A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or code
    execution, during service discovery, due to a redundant disconnect MGMT event.

    Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
    information disclosure via adjacent access.

    A flaw was discovered in the way Ansible templating was implemented in versions before
    2.6.18, 2.7.12 and 2.8.2, causing the possibility of information disclosure through
    unexpected variable substitution. By taking advantage of unintended variable substitution
    the content of any variable may be disclosed.

    ansible-playbook -k and ansible cli tools, all versions 2.8.x before 2.8.4, all 2.7.x
    before 2.7.13 and all 2.6.x before 2.6.19, prompt passwords by expanding them from
    templates as they could contain special characters. Passwords should be wrapped to prevent
    templates trigger and exposing them.

    In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5, ansible-engine 2.7.13,
    ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of
    credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This
    flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.

    Ansible, versions 2.9.x before 2.9.1, 2.8.x before 2.8.7 and Ansible versions 2.7.x before
    2.7.15, is not respecting the flag no_log set it to True when Sumologic and Splunk
    callback plugins are used send tasks results events to collectors. This would discloses
    and collects any sensitive data.

    A flaw was found in the solaris_zone module from the Ansible Community modules. When
    setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone name is checked by listing the
    process with the 'ps' bare command on the remote machine. An attacker could take advantage
    of this flaw by crafting the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the
    remote host. Ansible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are
    affected.

    A race condition flaw was found in Ansible Engine 2.7.17 and prior, 2.8.9 and prior, 2.9.6
    and prior when running a playbook with an unprivileged become user. When Ansible needs to
    run a module with become user, the temporary directory is created in /var/tmp. This
    directory is created with "umask 77 && mkdir -p <dir>"; this operation does not fail if
    the directory already exists and is owned by another user. An attacker could take
    advantage to gain control of the become user as the target directory can be retrieved by
    iterating '/proc/<pid>/cmdline'.

    A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine when the fetch module is used. An attacker could
    intercept the module, inject a new path, and then choose a new destination path on the
    controller node. All versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be
    vulnerable.

    A flaw was found in Ansible 2.7.16 and prior, 2.8.8 and prior, and 2.9.5 and prior when a
    password is set with the argument "password" of svn module, it is used on svn command
    line, disclosing to other users within the same node. An attacker could take advantage by
    reading the cmdline file from that particular PID on the procfs.

    A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when using Ansible Vault for editing encrypted files.
    When a user executes "ansible-vault edit", another user on the same computer can read the
    old and new secret, as it is created in a temporary file with mkstemp and the returned
    file descriptor is closed and the method write_data is called to write the existing secret
    in the file. This method will delete the file before recreating it insecurely. All
    versions in 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x branches are believed to be vulnerable.

    A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine affecting Ansible Engine versions 2.7.x before
    2.7.17 and 2.8.x before 2.8.11 and 2.9.x before 2.9.7 as well as Ansible Tower before and
    including versions 3.4.5 and 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 when the ldap_attr and ldap_entry community
    modules are used. The issue discloses the LDAP bind password to stdout or a log file if a
    playbook task is written using the bind_pw in the parameters field. The highest threat
    from this vulnerability is data confidentiality.

    A security flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all Ansible 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.17,
    all Ansible 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.11 and all Ansible 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7,
    when managing kubernetes using the k8s module. Sensitive parameters such as passwords and
    tokens are passed to kubectl from the command line, not using an environment variable or
    an input configuration file. This will disclose passwords and tokens from process list and
    no_log directive from debug module would not have any effect making these secrets being
    disclosed on stdout and log files.

    A flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x prior to 2.7.17,
    2.8.9 and 2.9.6 respectively, when using ansible_facts as a subkey of itself and promoting
    it to a variable when inject is enabled, overwriting the ansible_facts after the clean. An
    attacker could take advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts, such as
    ansible_hosts, users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation or
    code injection.

    A flaw was found in Ansible Engine affecting Ansible Engine versions 2.7.x before 2.7.17
    and 2.8.x before 2.8.11 and 2.9.x before 2.9.7 as well as Ansible Tower before and
    including versions 3.4.5 and 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 when using modules which decrypts vault files
    such as assemble, script, unarchive, win_copy, aws_s3 or copy modules. The temporary
    directory is created in /tmp leaves the s ts unencrypted. On Operating Systems which /tmp
    is not a tmpfs but part of the root partition, the directory is only cleared on boot and
    the decryp emains when the host is switched off. The system will be vulnerable when the
    system is not running. So decrypted data must be cleared as soon as possible and the data
    which normally is encrypted ble.

    A flaw was found in the use of insufficiently random values in Ansible. Two random
    password lookups of the same length generate the equal value as the template caching
    action for the same file since no re-evaluation happens. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability would be that all passwords are exposed at once for the file. This flaw
    affects Ansible Engine versions before 2.9.6.

    An Improper Output Neutralization for Logs flaw was found in Ansible when using the uri
    module, where sensitive data is exposed to content and json output. This flaw allows an
    attacker to access the logs or outputs of performed tasks to read keys used in playbooks
    from other users within the uri module. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
    data confidentiality.

    A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine when using module_args. Tasks executed with check
    mode (--check-mode) do not properly neutralize sensitive data exposed in the event data.
    This flaw allows unauthorized users to read this data. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality.

    A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine, in ansible-engine 2.8.x before 2.8.15 and
    ansible-engine 2.9.x before 2.9.13, when installing packages using the dnf module. GPG
    signatures are ignored during installation even when disable_gpg_check is set to False,
    which is the default behavior. This flaw leads to malicious packages being installed on
    the system and arbitrary code executed via package installation scripts. The highest
    threat from this vulnerability is to integrity and system availability.

    A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine 2.9.18, where sensitive info is not masked by
    default and is not protected by the no_log feature when using the sub-option feature of
    the basic.py module. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information. The
    highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.

    In Eclipse Jetty version 9.2.26 and older, 9.3.25 and older, and 9.4.15 and older, the
    server is vulnerable to XSS conditions if a remote client USES a specially formatted URL
    against the DefaultServlet or ResourceHandler that is configured for showing a Listing of
    directory contents.

    In Eclipse Jetty version 7.x, 8.x, 9.2.27 and older, 9.3.26 and older, and 9.4.16 and
    older, the server running on any OS and Jetty version combination will reveal the
    configured fully qualified directory base resource location on the output of the 404 error
    for not finding a Context that matches the requested path. The default server behavior on
    jetty-distribution and jetty-home will include at the end of the Handler tree a
    DefaultHandler, which is responsible for reporting this 404 error, it presents the various
    configured contexts as HTML for users to click through to. This produced HTML includes
    output that contains the configured fully qualified directory base resource location for
    each context.

    In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1 thru 10.0.0.beta2, and
    11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory
    is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of
    creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete
    the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will
    have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications,
    including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of
    this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.

    In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.6.v20170531 to 9.4.36.v20210114 (inclusive), 10.0.0, and 11.0.0 when
    Jetty handles a request containing multiple Accept headers with a large number of
    “quality” (i.e. q) parameters, the server may enter a denial of service (DoS) state due to
    high CPU usage processing those quality values, resulting in minutes of CPU time exhausted
    processing those quality values.

    In Eclipse Jetty 7.2.2 to 9.4.38, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.1, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.1,
    CPU usage can reach 100% upon receiving a large invalid TLS frame.

    For Eclipse Jetty versions <= 9.4.40, <= 10.0.2, <= 11.0.2, it is possible for requests to
    the ConcatServlet with a doubly encoded path to access protected resources within the
    WEB-INF directory. For example a request to `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve
    the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a
    web application.

    For Eclipse Jetty versions <= 9.4.40, <= 10.0.2, <= 11.0.2, if an exception is thrown from
    the SessionListener#sessionDestroyed() method, then the session ID is not invalidated in
    the session ID manager. On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this
    can result in a session not being invalidated. This can result in an application used on a
    shared computer being left logged in.

  description: |
    If Thunderbird was configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP connection, and an attacker
    injected IMAP server responses prior to the completion of the STARTTLS handshake, then
    Thunderbird didn't ignore the injected data. This could have resulted in Thunderbird
    showing incorrect information, for example the attacker could have tricked Thunderbird to
    show folders that didn't exist on the IMAP server. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
    < 78.12.

    A malicious webpage could have triggered a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a
    potentially exploitable crash. *This bug could only be triggered when accessibility was
    enabled.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.12, Firefox ESR < 78.12, and
    Firefox < 90.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in code shared between Firefox and
    Thunderbird. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
    with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.12, Firefox ESR < 78.12, and Firefox < 90.

    Out of bounds write in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.101 allowed a remote
    attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.

  description: |
    A malicious webpage could have triggered a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a
    potentially exploitable crash. *This bug could only be triggered when accessibility was
    enabled.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.12, Firefox ESR < 78.12, and
    Firefox < 90.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in code shared between Firefox and
    Thunderbird. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that
    with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.12, Firefox ESR < 78.12, and Firefox < 90.

    Out of bounds write in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.101 allowed a remote
    attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.

    A flaw was found in the ptp4l program of the linuxptp package. A missing length check when
    forwarding a PTP message between ports allows a remote attacker to cause an information
    leak, crash, or potentially remote code execution. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
    This flaw affects linuxptp versions before 3.1.1, before 2.0.1, before 1.9.3, before
    1.8.1, before 1.7.1, before 1.6.1 and before 1.5.1.

    Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a
    stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable,
    nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or
    compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the
    size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow

    Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Cookie header handled by
    mod_session can cause a NULL pointer dereference and crash, leading to a possible Denial
    Of Service

    In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 a specially crafted SessionHeader sent by
    an origin server could cause a heap overflow

    Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.39 to 2.4.46 Unexpected matching behavior with
    'MergeSlashes OFF'

    Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request
    headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1
    protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the
    client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response
    was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the
    very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference
    on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2
    request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue
    affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server
    2.4.47 was never released.

    In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using
    Firebird PDO driver extension, a malicious database server could cause crashes in various
    database functions, such as getAttribute(), execute(), fetch() and others by returning
    invalid response data that is not parsed correctly by the driver. This can result in
    crashes, denial of service or potentially memory corruption.

    In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using
    URL validation functionality via filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL parameter,
    an URL with invalid password field can be accepted as valid. This can lead to the code
    incorrectly parsing the URL and potentially leading to other security implications - like
    contacting a wrong server or making a wrong access decision.

    A flaw was found in the way nettle's RSA decryption functions handled specially crafted
    ciphertext. An attacker could use this flaw to provide a manipulated ciphertext leading to
    application crash and denial of service.

    A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature
    verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting
    in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing
    an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is
    to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

    Observable response discrepancy in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user
    to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

    Potential speculative code store bypass in all supported CPU products, in conjunction with
    software vulnerabilities relating to speculative execution of overwritten instructions,
    may cause an incorrect speculation and could result in data leakage.

    x86: TSX Async Abort protections not restored after S3 This issue relates to the TSX Async
    Abort speculative security vulnerability. Please see
    https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html for details. Mitigating TAA by disabling TSX
    (the default and preferred option) requires selecting a non-default setting in
    MSR_TSX_CTRL. This setting isn't restored after S3 suspend.

    inappropriate x86 IOMMU timeout detection / handling IOMMUs process commands issued to
    them in parallel with the operation of the CPU(s) issuing such commands. In the current
    implementation in Xen, asynchronous notification of the completion of such commands is not
    used. Instead, the issuing CPU spin-waits for the completion of the most recently issued
    command(s). Some of these waiting loops try to apply a timeout to fail overly-slow
    commands. The course of action upon a perceived timeout actually being detected is
    inappropriate: - on Intel hardware guests which did not originally cause the timeout may
    be marked as crashed, - on AMD hardware higher layer callers would not be notified of the
    issue, making them continue as if the IOMMU operation succeeded.

  description: |
    OpenPGP secret keys that were imported using Thunderbird version 78.8.1 up to version
    78.10.1 were stored unencrypted on the user's local disk. The master password protection
    was inactive for those keys. Version 78.10.2 will restore the protection mechanism for
    newly imported keys, and will automatically protect keys that had been imported using
    affected Thunderbird versions. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.10.2.

    If a MIME encoded email contains an OpenPGP inline signed or encrypted message part, but
    also contains an additional unprotected part, Thunderbird did not indicate that only parts
    of the message are protected. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.10.2.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88 and Firefox ESR
    78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
    enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.11, Firefox < 89, and Firefox ESR < 78.11.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 88 and Firefox ESR
    78.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
    enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.11, Firefox < 89, and Firefox ESR < 78.11.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a
    buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service. When resolving a request with the
    urn: scheme, the parser leaks a small amount of memory. However, there is an unspecified
    attack methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory consumption.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to incorrect parser
    validation, it allows a Denial of Service attack against the Cache Manager API. This
    allows a trusted client to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of
    Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is limited to clients with
    Cache Manager API access privilege.

    An issue was discovered in Squid 4.x before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. If a remote server
    sends a certain response header over HTTP or HTTPS, there is a denial of service. This
    header can plausibly occur in benign network traffic.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a
    memory-management bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack (against all clients
    using the proxy) via HTTP Range request processing.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. An integer overflow
    problem allows a remote server to achieve Denial of Service when delivering responses to
    HTTP Range requests. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP
    traffic without any malicious intent.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to an
    input-validation bug, it is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack (against all clients
    using the proxy). A client sends an HTTP Range request to trigger this.

    Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service
    (affecting availability to all clients) via an HTTP response. The issue trigger is a
    header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent by the
    server.

    LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for
    server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests
    with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the
    maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the
    maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and
    executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim
    encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be
    able to take full control of the running graphical session.

    lack of bounds check within the hivex_open function. An attacker could input a specially
    crafted Windows Registry (hive) file which would cause hivex to read memory beyond its
    normal bounds or cause the program to crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates
    as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack
    allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates
    as root in the spool directory (owned by a non-root user), an attacker can write to a
    /var/spool/exim4/input spool header file, in which a crafted recipient address can
    indirectly lead to command execution.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow because get_stdinput
    allows unbounded reads that are accompanied by unbounded increases in a certain size
    variable. NOTE: exploitation may be impractical because of the execution time needed to
    overflow (multiple days).

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Out-of-bounds Write because the main function, while setuid
    root, copies the current working directory pathname into a buffer that is too small (on
    some common platforms).

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Heap-based Buffer Overflow in queue_run via two sender
    options: -R and -S. This may cause privilege escalation from exim to root.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere
    because rda_interpret uses a privileged pipe that lacks a close-on-exec flag.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Heap-based Buffer Overflow because it mishandles "-F '.('" on
    the command line, and thus may allow privilege escalation from any user to root. This
    occurs because of the interpretation of negative sizes in strncpy.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. The -oP option is
    available to the exim user, and allows a denial of service because root-owned files can be
    overwritten.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 has Improper Neutralization of Line Delimiters. Local users can alter
    the behavior of root processes because a recipient address can have a newline character.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow in receive_add_recipient
    via an e-mail message with fifty million recipients. NOTE: remote exploitation may be
    difficult because of resource consumption.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 has Improper Initialization that can lead to recursion-based stack
    consumption or other consequences. This occurs because use of certain getc functions is
    mishandled when a client uses BDAT instead of DATA.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 has Improper Neutralization of Line Delimiters. An authenticated
    remote SMTP client can insert newline characters into a spool file (which indirectly leads
    to remote code execution as root) via AUTH= in a MAIL FROM command.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 has Improper Restriction of Write Operations within the Bounds of a
    Memory Buffer. This occurs when processing name=value pairs within MAIL FROM and RCPT TO
    commands.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Out-of-bounds Read. smtp_setup_msg may disclose sensitive
    information from process memory to an unauthenticated SMTP client.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Buffer Underwrite that may result in unauthenticated remote
    attackers executing arbitrary commands, because smtp_ungetc was only intended to push back
    characters, but can actually push back non-character error codes such as EOF.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Out-of-bounds Read because pdkim_finish_bodyhash does not
    validate the relationship between sig->bodyhash.len and b->bh.len; thus, a crafted
    DKIM-Signature header might lead to a leak of sensitive information from process memory.

    Exim 4 before 4.94.2 has Improper Neutralization of Line Delimiters, relevant in
    non-default configurations that enable Delivery Status Notification (DSN). Certain uses of
    ORCPT= can place a newline into a spool header file, and indirectly allow unauthenticated
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root.

    release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable
    version of named receives a malformed IXFR triggering the flaw described above, the named
    process will terminate due to a failed assertion the next time the transferred secondary
    zone is refreshed.

    In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and
    9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions
    9.17.0 -> 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named
    receives a query for a record triggering the flaw described above, the named process will
    terminate due to a failed assertion check. The vulnerability affects all currently
    maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other
    versions of BIND 9.

    In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and
    9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions
    9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they
    are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a
    configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed,
    but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the
    tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default
    configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is
    integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers
    with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC
    SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture
    for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can
    be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries
    compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a
    buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined
    that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos
    libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
    implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND
    users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND
    9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove
    something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries
    can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for
    reasons of stability and security.

    Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial repositories in the root
    composer.json and package source download URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically
    crafted URL values allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed
    on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file
    is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by
    third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source
    code from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing user input to
    Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger
    remote code execution. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private
    Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review
    of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other services/tools
    using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade
    their composer/composer dependency immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include

    Further techniques that built on the slipstream research combined with a malicious webpage
    could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the
    user's local machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85.

    If a Thunderbird user has previously imported Alice's OpenPGP key, and Alice has extended
    the validity period of her key, but Alice's updated key has not yet been imported, an
    attacker may send an email containing a crafted version of Alice's key with an invalid
    subkey, Thunderbird might subsequently attempt to use the invalid subkey, and will fail to
    send encrypted email to Alice. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.

    Thunderbird did not check if the user ID associated with an OpenPGP key has a valid self
    signature. An attacker may create a crafted version of an OpenPGP key, by either replacing
    the original user ID, or by adding another user ID. If Thunderbird imports and accepts the
    crafted key, the Thunderbird user may falsely conclude that the false user ID belongs to
    the correspondent. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.

    An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a
    correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an
    invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird
    may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing
    encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.

    A WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough, resulting in memory corruption and
    an out of bound write. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird <
    78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    When Responsive Design Mode was enabled, it used references to objects that were
    previously freed. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and
    Firefox < 88.

    Through complicated navigations with new windows, an HTTP page could have inherited a
    secure lock icon from an HTTPS page. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10,
    Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    If a Blob URL was loaded through some unusual user interaction, it could have been loaded
    by the System Principal and granted additional privileges that should not be granted to
    web content. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and
    Firefox < 88.

    When a user clicked on an FTP URL containing encoded newline characters (%0A and %0D), the
    newlines would have been interpreted as such and allowed arbitrary commands to be sent to
    the FTP server. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and
    Firefox < 88.

    The WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could lead to a
    null read and result in a crash. *Note: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other
    platforms are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird <
    78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    Ports that were written as an integer overflow above the bounds of a 16-bit integer could
    have bypassed port blocking restrictions when used in the Alt-Svc header. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    Signatures are written to disk before and read during verification, which might be subject
    to a race condition when a malicious local process or user is replacing the file. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.10.

    When loading the shared library that provides the OTR protocol implementation, Thunderbird
    will initially attempt to open it using a filename that isn't distributed by Thunderbird.
    If a computer has already been infected with a malicious library of the alternative
    filename, and the malicious library has been copied to a directory that is contained in
    the search path for executable libraries, then Thunderbird will load the incorrect
    library. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.

    Wordpress is an open source CMS. A user with the ability to upload files (like an Author)
    can exploit an XML parsing issue in the Media Library leading to XXE attacks. This
    requires WordPress installation to be using PHP 8. Access to internal files is possible in
    a successful XXE attack. This has been patched in WordPress version 5.7.1, along with the
    older affected versions via a minor release. We strongly recommend you keep auto-updates
    enabled.

    Wordpress is an open source CMS. One of the blocks in the WordPress editor can be
    exploited in a way that exposes password-protected posts and pages. This requires at least
    contributor privileges. This has been patched in WordPress 5.7.1, along with the older
    affected versions via minor releases. It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates

    Further techniques that built on the slipstream research combined with a malicious webpage
    could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the
    user's local machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85.

    A WebGL framebuffer was not initialized early enough, resulting in memory corruption and
    an out of bound write. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird <
    78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    When Responsive Design Mode was enabled, it used references to objects that were
    previously freed. We presume that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and
    Firefox < 88.

    Through complicated navigations with new windows, an HTTP page could have inherited a
    secure lock icon from an HTTPS page. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10,
    Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    If a Blob URL was loaded through some unusual user interaction, it could have been loaded
    by the System Principal and granted additional privileges that should not be granted to
    web content. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and
    Firefox < 88.

    When a user clicked on an FTP URL containing encoded newline characters (%0A and %0D), the
    newlines would have been interpreted as such and allowed arbitrary commands to be sent to
    the FTP server. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and
    Firefox < 88.

    The WebAssembly JIT could miscalculate the size of a return type, which could lead to a
    null read and result in a crash. *Note: This issue only affected x86-32 platforms. Other
    platforms are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird <
    78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    Ports that were written as an integer overflow above the bounds of a 16-bit integer could
    have bypassed port blocking restrictions when used in the Alt-Svc header. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.10, Thunderbird < 78.10, and Firefox < 88.

    When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to
    10.0.0, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 could duplicate request headers and a
    limited amount of request body from one request to another meaning user A and user B could
    both see the results of user A's request.

    The fix for CVE-2020-9484 was incomplete. When using Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0,
    9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41, 8.5.0 to 8.5.61 or 7.0.0. to 7.0.107 with a configuration edge case
    that was highly unlikely to be used, the Tomcat instance was still vulnerable to
    CVE-2020-9494. Note that both the previously published prerequisites for CVE-2020-9484 and
    the previously published mitigations for CVE-2020-9484 also apply to this issue.

    An infinite loop in SMLLexer in Pygments versions 1.5 to 2.7.3 may lead to denial of
    service when performing syntax highlighting of a Standard ML (SML) source file, as
    demonstrated by input that only contains the "exception" keyword.

    In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely
    heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic
    worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an
    attacker can cause a denial of service.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.13 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before
    1.35.2. When using the MediaWiki API to "protect" a page, a user is currently able to
    protect to a higher level than they currently have permissions for.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before
    1.35.2. On Special:NewFiles, all the mediastatistics-header-* messages are output in HTML
    unescaped, leading to XSS.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before
    1.35.2. ContentModelChange does not check if a user has correct permissions to create and
    set the content model of a nonexistent page.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before
    1.35.2. On ChangesList special pages such as Special:RecentChanges and Special:Watchlist,
    some of the rcfilters-filter-* label messages are output in HTML unescaped, leading to
    XSS.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before
    1.35.2. Blocked users are unable to use Special:ResetTokens. This has security relevance
    because a blocked user might have accidentally shared a token, or might know that a token
    has been compromised, and yet is not able to block any potential future use of the token
    by an unauthorized party.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before
    1.35.2. Users can bypass intended restrictions on deleting pages in certain "fast double
    move" situations. MovePage::isValidMoveTarget() uses FOR UPDATE, but it's only called if
    Title::getArticleID() returns non-zero with no special flags. Next,
    MovePage::moveToInternal() will delete the page if getArticleID(READ_LATEST) is non-zero.
    Therefore, if the page is missing in the replica DB, isValidMove() will return true, and
    then moveToInternal() will unconditionally delete the page if it can be found in the
    master.

    An issue was discovered in Xen 4.9 through 4.14.x. On Arm, a guest is allowed to control
    whether memory accesses are bypassing the cache. This means that Xen needs to ensure that
    all writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached the memory before handing over
    the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the operation to clean the cache is happening before
    checking if the page was scrubbed. Therefore there is no guarantee when all the writes
    will reach the memory.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to
    achieve unintended read/write DMA access, and possibly cause a denial of service (host OS
    crash) or gain privileges. This occurs because a backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU
    updates were not always correct. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
    CVE-2020-15565.

  title: netty -- security update
  issued: 05 Apr 2021
  affected_source_package: netty

    version: 1:4.1.33-1+deb10u3
    architecture: all

  description: |
    HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows an HTTP header that lacks a colon,
    which might be interpreted as a separate header with an incorrect syntax, or might be
    interpreted as an "invalid fold."

    HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows a Content-Length header to be
    accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header.

    Netty 4.1.43.Final allows HTTP Request Smuggling because it mishandles Transfer-Encoding
    whitespace (such as a [space]Transfer-Encoding:chunked line) and a later Content-Length
    header. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-16869.

    The ZlibDecoders in Netty 4.1.x before 4.1.46 allow for unbounded memory allocation while
    decoding a ZlibEncoded byte stream. An attacker could send a large ZlibEncoded byte stream
    to the Netty server, forcing the server to allocate all of its free memory to a single
    decoder.

    Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid
    development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before
    version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure
    temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur
    via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is
    enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As
    such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory
    permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS
    Operating Systems. The method "File.createTempFile" on unix-like systems creates a random
    file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions "-rw-r--r--". Thus, if
    sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this
    information. This is the case in netty's "AbstractDiskHttpData" is vulnerable. This has
    been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own
    "java.io.tmpdir" when you start the JVM or use "DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)" to
    set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.

    Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid
    development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty
    (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that
    enables request smuggling. If a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2
    request, the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up.
    This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1. If the request
    comes in as an HTTP/2 stream, gets converted into the HTTP/1.1 domain objects
    (`HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, etc.) via `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then sent
    up to the child channel's pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP/1.1 this may
    result in request smuggling. In a proxy case, users may assume the content-length is
    validated somehow, which is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a backend channel
    that is a HTTP/1.1 connection, the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be checked.
    An attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to
    HTTP/1.1. For an example attack refer to the linked GitHub Advisory. Users are only
    affected if all of this is true: `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used,
    `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP/1.1 objects, and these
    HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer. This has been patched in
    4.1.60.Final As a workaround, the user can do the validation by themselves by implementing
    a custom `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind
    `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.

    Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid
    development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty
    (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that
    enables request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly validated if the
    request only uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to true. This could
    lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to
    HTTP/1.1. This is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix
    this one case. This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.

    A NULL pointer dereference, or possible use-after-free flaw was found in Samba AD LDAP
    server in versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11 and before 4.12.4. Although some
    versions of Samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not support Samba in AD mode,
    the affected code is shipped with the libldb package. This flaw allows an authenticated
    user to possibly trigger a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference. The highest threat
    from this vulnerability is to system availability.

    A flaw was found in samba. Spaces used in a string around a domain name (DN), while
    supposed to be ignored, can cause invalid DN strings with spaces to instead write a
    zero-byte into out-of-bounds memory, resulting in a crash. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to system availability.

    A flaw was found in Samba's libldb. Multiple, consecutive leading spaces in an LDAP
    attribute can lead to an out-of-bounds memory write, leading to a crash of the LDAP server
    process handling the request. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system
    availability.

    OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow in opj_t1_clbl_decode_processor in
    openjp2/t1.c because of lack of opj_j2k_update_image_dimensions validation.

    opj_t1_clbl_decode_processor in openjp2/t1.c in OpenJPEG 2.3.1 through 2020-01-28 has a
    heap-based buffer overflow in the qmfbid==1 case, a different issue than CVE-2020-6851.

    jp2/opj_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a use-after-free that can be triggered
    if there is a mix of valid and invalid files in a directory operated on by the
    decompressor. Triggering a double-free may also be possible. This is related to calling
    opj_image_destroy twice.

    A heap-buffer overflow was found in the way openjpeg2 handled certain PNG format files. An
    attacker could use this flaw to cause an application crash or in some cases execute
    arbitrary code with the permission of the user running such an application.

    A flaw was found in OpenJPEG’s encoder. This flaw allows an attacker to pass specially
    crafted x,y offset input to OpenJPEG to use during encoding. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in OpenJPEG’s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function.
    This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause
    a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

    There's a flaw in openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0 in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c. When an
    attacker is able to provide crafted input to be processed by the openjpeg encoder, this
    could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest impact from this flaw is to application
    availability.

    There's a flaw in openjpeg's t2 encoder in versions prior to 2.4.0. An attacker who is

    A flaw was found in OpenJPEG in versions prior to 2.4.0. This flaw allows an attacker to
    provide specially crafted input to the conversion or encoding functionality, causing an
    out-of-bounds read. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.

    There's a flaw in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c of openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0. If an

    curl 7.62.0 through 7.70.0 is vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability that
    can lead to a partial password being leaked over the network and to the DNS server(s).

    curl 7.20.0 through 7.70.0 is vulnerable to improper restriction of names for files and
    other resources that can lead too overwriting a local file when the -J flag is used.

    Due to use of a dangling pointer, libcurl 7.29.0 through 7.71.1 can use the wrong
    connection when sending data.

    A malicious server can use the FTP PASV response to trick curl 7.73.0 and earlier into
    connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way potentially make curl extract
    information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed, for example doing
    port scanning and service banner extractions.

    curl 7.21.0 to and including 7.73.0 is vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion due to a stack
    overflow issue in FTP wildcard match parsing.

    curl 7.41.0 through 7.73.0 is vulnerable to an improper check for certificate revocation
    due to insufficient verification of the OCSP response.

    curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an "Exposure of Private Personal
    Information to an Unauthorized Actor" by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header.
    libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the
    Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking
    sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.

    curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows a malicious HTTPS
    proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of TLS 1.3 session tickets. When using a
    HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy
    but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly "short-cut" the host
    handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong
    session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check
    and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious
    HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for
    an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.

    A texture upload of a Pixel Buffer Object could have confused the WebGL code to skip
    binding the buffer used to unpack it, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially
    exploitable information leak or crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9,
    Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have
    scanned both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local
    machine utilizing WebRTC connections. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9,
    Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    A malicious extension could have opened a popup window lacking an address bar. The title
    of the popup lacking an address bar should not be fully controllable, but in this
    situation was. This could have been used to spoof a website and attempt to trick the user
    into providing credentials. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9, Firefox < 87,
    and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86
    and Firefox ESR 78.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9, Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    Thunderbird unprotects a secret OpenPGP key prior to using it for a decryption, signing or
    key import task. If the task runs into a failure, the secret key may remain in memory in
    its unprotected state. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.8.1.

    An out of date graphics library (Angle) likely contained vulnerabilities that could
    potentially be exploited. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9 and Firefox ESR <
    78.9.

  description: |
    An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello
    message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the
    signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but
    includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will
    result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if
    it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS
    clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this
    issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not
    impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).

    A texture upload of a Pixel Buffer Object could have confused the WebGL code to skip
    binding the buffer used to unpack it, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially
    exploitable information leak or crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9,
    Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have
    scanned both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local
    machine utilizing WebRTC connections. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9,
    Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    A malicious extension could have opened a popup window lacking an address bar. The title
    of the popup lacking an address bar should not be fully controllable, but in this
    situation was. This could have been used to spoof a website and attempt to trick the user
    into providing credentials. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9, Firefox < 87,
    and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86
    and Firefox ESR 78.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9, Firefox < 87, and Thunderbird < 78.9.

    A transient execution vulnerability, named Floating Point Value Injection (FPVI) allowed
    an attacker to leak arbitrary memory addresses and may have also enabled JIT type
    confusion attacks. (A related vulnerability, Speculative Code Store Bypass (SCSB), did not
    affect Firefox.). This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.9 and Firefox < 87.

    An out of date graphics library (Angle) likely contained vulnerabilities that could
    potentially be exploited. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9 and Firefox ESR <
    78.9.

    Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications
    on Linux. In Flatpack since version 0.9.4 and before version 1.10.2 has a vulnerability in
    the "file forwarding" feature which can be used by an attacker to gain access to files
    that would not ordinarily be allowed by the app's permissions. By putting the special
    tokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the Exec field of a Flatpak app's .desktop file, a malicious
    app publisher can trick flatpak into behaving as though the user had chosen to open a
    target file with their Flatpak app, which automatically makes that file available to the
    Flatpak app. This is fixed in version 1.10.2. A minimal solution is the first commit
    "`Disallow @@ and @@U usage in desktop files`". The follow-up commits "`dir: Reserve the
    whole @@ prefix`" and "`dir: Refuse to export .desktop files with suspicious uses of @@
    tokens`" are recommended, but not strictly required. As a workaround, avoid installing
    Flatpak apps from untrusted sources, or check the contents of the exported `.desktop`
    files in `exports/share/applications/*.desktop` (typically
    `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop` and
    `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop`) to make sure that literal
    filenames do not follow `@@` or `@@u`.

  description: |
    A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06, where it incorrectly enables the
    usage of the ACPI command when Secure Boot is enabled. This flaw allows an attacker with
    privileged access to craft a Secondary System Description Table (SSDT) containing code to
    overwrite the Linux kernel lockdown variable content directly into memory. The table is
    further loaded and executed by the kernel, defeating its Secure Boot lockdown and allowing
    the attacker to load unsigned code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
    confidentiality and integrity, as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the
    unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module
    is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to
    be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. During USB device initialization,
    descriptors are read with very little bounds checking and assumes the USB device is
    providing sane values. If properly exploited, an attacker could trigger memory corruption
    leading to arbitrary code execution allowing a bypass of the Secure Boot mechanism. The
    highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as
    system availability.

    A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Variable names present are expanded
    in the supplied command line into their corresponding variable contents, using a 1kB stack
    buffer for temporary storage, without sufficient bounds checking. If the function is
    called with a command line that references a variable with a sufficiently large payload,
    it is possible to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame and control execution
    which could also circumvent Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this
    vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The cutmem command does not honor
    secure boot locking allowing an privileged attacker to remove address ranges from memory
    creating an opportunity to circumvent SecureBoot protections after proper triage about
    grub's memory layout. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
    confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The option parser allows an attacker
    to write past the end of a heap-allocated buffer by calling certain commands with a large
    number of specific short forms of options. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
    to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in the menu
    rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that expressing a quoted
    single quote will require 3 characters, while it actually requires 4 characters which
    allows an attacker to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input. The highest
    threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
    availability.

  description: |
    If Content Security Policy blocked frame navigation, the full destination of a redirect
    served in the frame was reported in the violation report; as opposed to the original frame
    URI. This could be used to leak sensitive information contained in such URIs. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.

    As specified in the W3C Content Security Policy draft, when creating a violation report,
    "User agents need to ensure that the source file is the URL requested by the page,
    pre-redirects. If that’s not possible, user agents need to strip the URL down to an origin
    to avoid unintentional leakage." Under certain types of redirects, Firefox incorrectly set
    the source file to be the destination of the redirects. This was fixed to be the redirect
    destination's origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and
    Firefox ESR < 78.8.

    When trying to load a cross-origin resource in an audio/video context a decoding error may
    have resulted, and the content of that error may have revealed information about the
    resource. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR <
    78.8.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 85 and Firefox ESR 78.7.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.

    In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before version 1.2.14 there is a
    credential leaking vulnerability. If a container image manifest in the OCI Image format or
    Docker Image V2 Schema 2 format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer
    (otherwise known as a “foreign layer”), the default containerd resolver will follow that
    URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd
    resolver will provide its authentication credentials if the server where the URL is
    located presents an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP headers. If an
    attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that directs one of the layers to be
    fetched from a web server they control and they trick a user or system into pulling the
    image, they can obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases, this
    may be the user's username and password for the registry. In other cases, this may be the
    credentials attached to the cloud virtual instance which can grant access to other cloud
    resources in the account. The default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd
    plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool, and other client
    programs that have explicitly linked against it. This vulnerability has been fixed in
    containerd 1.2.14. containerd 1.3 and later are not affected. If you are using containerd
    1.3 or later, you are not affected. If you are using cri-containerd in the 1.2 series or
    prior, you should ensure you only pull images from trusted sources. Other container
    runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the default resolver (such as Docker)
    are not affected.

    containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for
    Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API
    is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API
    socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not
    otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious
    containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0
    but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated
    privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should
    update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers
    started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running
    containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing
    the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the
    shim (typically the "host" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or
    hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not
    vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration,
    you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny
    unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of
    privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers
    strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation
    mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege,
    regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.

    In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the
    --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real
    root. When using "--userns-remap", if the root user in the remapped namespace has access
    to the host filesystem they can modify files under "/var/lib/docker/<remapping>" that
    cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain
    patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.

    In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability in which pulling an
    intentionally malformed Docker image manifest crashes the dockerd daemon. Versions 20.10.3
    and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent the daemon from crashing.

    aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In aiohttp
    before version 3.7.4 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link
    to an aiohttp-based web-server could redirect the browser to a different website. It is
    caused by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware.
    This security problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency using pip as
    follows "pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4". If upgrading is not an option for you, a
    workaround can be to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in
    your applications.

    Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service
    attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This
    leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the
    system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also
    from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an
    excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.

    Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding
    attacks as the whitelist includes “localhost6”. When “localhost6” is not present in
    /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If
    the attacker controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS
    rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the
    attacker uses the “localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described in
    CVE-2018-7160.

    If Content Security Policy blocked frame navigation, the full destination of a redirect
    served in the frame was reported in the violation report; as opposed to the original frame
    URI. This could be used to leak sensitive information contained in such URIs. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.

    As specified in the W3C Content Security Policy draft, when creating a violation report,
    "User agents need to ensure that the source file is the URL requested by the page,
    pre-redirects. If that’s not possible, user agents need to strip the URL down to an origin
    to avoid unintentional leakage." Under certain types of redirects, Firefox incorrectly set
    the source file to be the destination of the redirects. This was fixed to be the redirect
    destination's origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and
    Firefox ESR < 78.8.

    When trying to load a cross-origin resource in an audio/video context a decoding error may
    have resulted, and the content of that error may have revealed information about the
    resource. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR <
    78.8.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 85 and Firefox ESR 78.7.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.

  description: |
    BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to
    use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the
    vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
    setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration
    options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used
    in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments
    that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely
    outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process.
    However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
    9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and
    9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also release versions 9.17.0 ->
    9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.33, 7.3.x below 7.3.21 and 7.4.x below 7.4.9, while
    processing PHAR files using phar extension, phar_parse_zipfile could be tricked into
    accessing freed memory, which could lead to a crash or information disclosure.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when
    AES-CCM mode is used with openssl_encrypt() function with 12 bytes IV, only first 7 bytes
    of the IV is actually used. This can lead to both decreased security and incorrect
    encryption data.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when PHP is
    processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to
    cookies with prefixes like __Host confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus
    leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. See also
    CVE-2020-8184 for more information.

    In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.26, 7.4.x below 7.4.14 and 8.0.0, when validating URL with
    functions like filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL), PHP will accept an URL with invalid
    password as valid URL. This may lead to functions that rely on URL being valid to
    mis-parse the URL and produce wrong data as components of the URL.

    In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.27, 7.4.x below 7.4.15 and 8.0.x below 8.0.2, when using
    SOAP extension to connect to a SOAP server, a malicious SOAP server could return malformed
    XML data as a response that would cause PHP to access a null pointer and thus cause a
    crash.

    There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in
    exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that
    attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect
    would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are
    considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512
    private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low
    level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e
    (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).

    Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output
    length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable
    length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function
    call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This
    could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below
    are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j.
    OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out
    of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL
    1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL
    1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

    The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique
    hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509
    certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing
    the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This
    may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial
    of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by
    OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and
    they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL
    versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should
    upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue.
    However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium
    support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to
    1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected
    1.0.2-1.0.2x).

    A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was
    discovered in the way RRSets are sorted before validating with DNSSEC data. An attacker on
    the network, who can forge DNS replies such as that they are accepted as valid, could use
    this flaw to cause a buffer overflow with arbitrary data in a heap memory segment,
    possibly executing code on the machine. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
    data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in dnsmasq before 2.83. A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in
    the way dnsmasq extract names from DNS packets before validating them with DNSSEC data. An
    attacker on the network, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an
    overflow with arbitrary data in a heap-allocated memory, possibly executing code on the
    machine. The flaw is in the rfc1035.c:extract_name() function, which writes data to the
    memory pointed by name assuming MAXDNAME*2 bytes are available in the buffer. However, in
    some code execution paths, it is possible extract_name() gets passed an offset from the
    base buffer, thus reducing, in practice, the number of available bytes that can be written
    in the buffer. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and
    integrity as well as system availability.

    A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was
    discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received DNS
    entries. A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause
    an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks
    in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with
    a negative size in get_rdata() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of
    service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

    A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded
    query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if the reply destination address/port
    is used by the pending forwarded queries. However, it does not use the address/port to
    retrieve the exact forwarded query, substantially reducing the number of attempts an
    attacker on the network would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by
    dnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies a query's attributes that all
    must be used to match a reply. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a DNS Cache
    Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity
    of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
    integrity.

    A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded
    query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is the forwarded query that
    matches the reply, by only using a weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash
    (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an
    off-path attacker to find several different domains all having the same hash,
    substantially reducing the number of attempts they would have to perform to forge a reply
    and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that the
    query name is one of the attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply. This
    flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with
    CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat
    from this vulnerability is to data integrity.

    A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query, dnsmasq does not
    check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards a new request. By
    default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be
    at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the
    network to substantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to perform to
    forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the "Birthday
    Attacks" section of RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a
    successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
    integrity.

  description: |
    During the plaintext phase of the STARTTLS connection setup, protocol commands could have
    been injected and evaluated within the encrypted session. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 78.7.

    Use after free in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a remote attacker
    to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted SCTP packet.

    When a HTTPS pages was embedded in a HTTP page, and there was a service worker registered
    for the former, the service worker could have intercepted the request for the secure page
    despite the iframe not being a secure context due to the (insecure) framing. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.

    If a user clicked into a specifically crafted PDF, the PDF reader could be confused into
    leaking cross-origin information, when said information is served as chunked data. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR < 78.7.

    Using the new logical assignment operators in a JavaScript switch statement could have
    caused a type confusion, leading to a memory corruption and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR <
    78.7.

    Performing garbage collection on re-declared JavaScript variables resulted in a
    user-after-poison, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR < 78.7.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR < 78.7.

    When a HTTPS pages was embedded in a HTTP page, and there was a service worker registered
    for the former, the service worker could have intercepted the request for the secure page
    despite the iframe not being a secure context due to the (insecure) framing. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 84.

    If a user clicked into a specifically crafted PDF, the PDF reader could be confused into
    leaking cross-origin information, when said information is served as chunked data. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR < 78.7.

    Using the new logical assignment operators in a JavaScript switch statement could have
    caused a type confusion, leading to a memory corruption and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR <
    78.7.

    Performing garbage collection on re-declared JavaScript variables resulted in a
    user-after-poison, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR < 78.7.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 85, Thunderbird < 78.7, and Firefox ESR < 78.7.

    A flaw was found in multiple versions of OpenvSwitch. Specially crafted LLDP packets can
    cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs, potentially

    If an HTTP/2 client connecting to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M7, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.37
    or 8.5.0 to 8.5.57 exceeded the agreed maximum number of concurrent streams for a
    connection (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol), it was possible that a subsequent
    request made on that connection could contain HTTP headers - including HTTP/2 pseudo
    headers - from a previous request rather than the intended headers. This could lead to
    users seeing responses for unexpected resources.

    While investigating bug 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9,
    9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 could re-use an HTTP request header value from the
    previous stream received on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the
    subsequent stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the
    HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.

    Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications
    on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed
    applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This
    sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and
    1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus
    service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch
    their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings
    as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in
    Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process
    untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the
    browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified
    environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to
    the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or
    compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak
    run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a
    workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service
    from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly.
    This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.

  description: |
    Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Coturn before version
    4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect and relay packets to loopback addresses
    in the range of `127.x.x.x`. However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT`
    request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received
    and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is
    able to relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on
    IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of either
    `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address,
    a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless
    `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default
    configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may
    choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in version 4.5.2. As a
    workaround the addresses in the address block `0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be
    denied by default unless `--allow-loopback-peers` has been specified.

    Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a
    use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket,
    node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap
    object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is
    passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited
    to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.

    Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 allow two copies of a header
    field in an HTTP request (for example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields). In this case,
    Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP
    Request Smuggling.

    An issue was discovered in Dovecot before 2.3.13. By using IMAP IDLE, an authenticated
    attacker can trigger unhibernation via attacker-controlled parameters, leading to access
    to other users' email messages (and path disclosure).

    Dovecot before 2.3.13 has Improper Input Validation in lda, lmtp, and imap, leading to an
    application crash via a crafted email message with certain choices for ten thousand MIME

    In MediaWiki before 1.35.1, the messages userrights-expiry-current and
    userrights-expiry-none can contain raw HTML. XSS can happen when a user visits
    Special:UserRights but does not have rights to change all userrights, and the table on the
    left side has unchangeable groups in it. (The right column with the changeable groups is
    not affected and is escaped correctly.)

    MediaWiki before 1.35.1 blocks legitimate attempts to hide log entries in some situations.
    If one sets MediaWiki:Mainpage to Special:MyLanguage/Main Page, visits a log entry on
    Special:Log, and toggles the "Change visibility of selected log entries" checkbox (or a
    tags checkbox) next to it, there is a redirection to the main page's action=historysubmit
    (instead of the desired behavior in which a revision-deletion form appears).

    MediaWiki before 1.35.1 allows XSS via BlockLogFormatter.php.
    Language::translateBlockExpiry itself does not escape in all code paths. For example, the
    return of Language::userTimeAndDate is is always unsafe for HTML in a month value. This
    affects MediaWiki 1.12.0 and later.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.1. Missing users (accounts that don't
    exist) and hidden users (accounts that have been explicitly hidden due to being abusive,
    or similar) that the viewer cannot see are handled differently, exposing sensitive
    information about the hidden status to unprivileged viewers. This exists on various code
    paths.

  description: |
    Uninitialized Use in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.88 allowed a remote attacker
    to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page.

    Certain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading to a heap
    buffer overflow on some video drivers. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84,
    Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    Certain input to the CSS Sanitizer confused it, resulting in incorrect components being
    removed. This could have been used as a sanitizer bypass. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    When flex-basis was used on a table wrapper, a StyleGenericFlexBasis object could have
    been incorrectly cast to the wrong type. This resulted in a heap user-after-free, memory
    corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84,
    Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have
    exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local
    machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR <
    78.6.

    When an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive <all_urls>, the
    proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web content cannot
    navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have inadvertently leaked their IP
    address. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR <
    78.6.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    The Apache Xerces-C 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 XML parser contains a use-after-free error triggered
    during the scanning of external DTDs. This flaw has not been addressed in the maintained
    version of the library and has no current mitigation other than to disable DTD processing.
    This can be accomplished via the DOM using a standard parser feature, or via SAX using the
    XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment variable.

    Uninitialized Use in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.88 allowed a remote attacker
    to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a crafted HTML page.

    Certain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading to a heap
    buffer overflow on some video drivers. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84,
    Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    Certain input to the CSS Sanitizer confused it, resulting in incorrect components being
    removed. This could have been used as a sanitizer bypass. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    When flex-basis was used on a table wrapper, a StyleGenericFlexBasis object could have
    been incorrectly cast to the wrong type. This resulted in a heap user-after-free, memory
    corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84,
    Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have
    exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local
    machine. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR <
    78.6.

    When an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive <all_urls>, the
    proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web content cannot
    navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have inadvertently leaked their IP
    address. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR <
    78.6.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 84, Thunderbird < 78.6, and Firefox ESR < 78.6.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. In the Ocaml xenstored implementation, the
    internal representation of the tree has special cases for the root node, because this node
    has no parent. Unfortunately, permissions were not checked for certain operations on the
    root node. Unprivileged guests can get and modify permissions, list, and delete the root
    node. (Deleting the whole xenstore tree is a host-wide denial of service.) Achieving
    xenstore write access is also possible. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable.
    Building and using oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the
    Ocaml compiler is available. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Neither xenstore implementation does any
    permission checks when reporting a xenstore watch event. A guest administrator can watch
    the root xenstored node, which will cause notifications for every created, modified, and
    deleted key. A guest administrator can also use the special watches, which will cause a
    notification every time a domain is created and destroyed. Data may include: number, type,
    and domids of other VMs; existence and domids of driver domains; numbers of virtual
    interfaces, block devices, vcpus; existence of virtual framebuffers and their backend
    style (e.g., existence of VNC service); Xen VM UUIDs for other domains; timing information
    about domain creation and device setup; and some hints at the backend provisioning of VMs
    and their devices. The watch events do not contain values stored in xenstore, only key
    names. A guest administrator can observe non-sensitive domain and device lifecycle events
    relating to other guests. This information allows some insight into overall system
    configuration (including the number and general nature of other guests), and configuration
    of other guests (including the number and general nature of other guests' devices). This
    information might be commercially interesting or might make other attacks easier. There is
    not believed to be exposure of sensitive data. Specifically, there is no exposure of VNC
    passwords, port numbers, pathnames in host and guest filesystems, cryptographic keys, or
    within-guest data.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of Xenstore nodes are per
    domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access rights are not removed when a domain is
    being destroyed. This means that a new domain created with the same domid will inherit the
    access rights to Xenstore nodes from the previous domain(s) with the same domid. Because
    all Xenstore entries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid> are being deleted by Xen tools
    when a guest is destroyed, only Xenstore entries of other guests still running are
    affected. For example, a newly created guest domain might be able to read sensitive
    information that had belonged to a previously existing guest domain. Both Xenstore
    implementations (C and Ocaml) are vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A guest may access xenstore paths via
    absolute paths containing a full pathname, or via a relative path, which implicitly
    includes /local/domain/$DOMID for their own domain id. Management tools must access paths
    in guests' namespaces, necessarily using absolute paths. oxenstored imposes a pathname
    limit that is applied solely to the relative or absolute path specified by the client.
    Therefore, a guest can create paths in its own namespace which are too long for management
    tools to access. Depending on the toolstack in use, a malicious guest administrator might
    cause some management tools and debugging operations to fail. For example, a guest
    administrator can cause "xenstore-ls -r" to fail. However, a guest administrator cannot
    prevent the host administrator from tearing down the domain. All systems using oxenstored
    are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen
    distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems using C xenstored are not
    vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Xenstored and guests communicate via a
    shared memory page using a specific protocol. When a guest violates this protocol,
    xenstored will drop the connection to that guest. Unfortunately, this is done by just
    removing the guest from xenstored's internal management, resulting in the same actions as
    if the guest had been destroyed, including sending an @releaseDomain event. @releaseDomain
    events do not say that the guest has been removed. All watchers of this event must look at
    the states of all guests to find the guest that has been removed. When an @releaseDomain
    is generated due to a domain xenstored protocol violation, because the guest is still
    running, the watchers will not react. Later, when the guest is actually destroyed,
    xenstored will no longer have it stored in its internal data base, so no further
    @releaseDomain event will be sent. This can lead to a zombie domain; memory mappings of
    that guest's memory will not be removed, due to the missing event. This zombie domain will
    be cleaned up only after another domain is destroyed, as that will trigger another
    @releaseDomain event. If the device model of the guest that violated the Xenstore protocol
    is running in a stub-domain, a use-after-free case could happen in xenstored, after having
    removed the guest from its internal data base, possibly resulting in a crash of xenstored.
    A malicious guest can block resources of the host for a period after its own death. Guests
    with a stub domain device model can eventually crash xenstored, resulting in a more
    serious denial of service (the prevention of any further domain management operations).
    Only the C variant of Xenstore is affected; the Ocaml variant is not affected. Only HVM
    guests with a stubdom device model can cause a serious DoS.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When a Xenstore watch fires, the xenstore
    client that registered the watch will receive a Xenstore message containing the path of
    the modified Xenstore entry that triggered the watch, and the tag that was specified when
    registering the watch. Any communication with xenstored is done via Xenstore messages,
    consisting of a message header and the payload. The payload length is limited to 4096
    bytes. Any request to xenstored resulting in a response with a payload longer than 4096
    bytes will result in an error. When registering a watch, the payload length limit applies
    to the combined length of the watched path and the specified tag. Because watches for a
    specific path are also triggered for all nodes below that path, the payload of a watch
    event message can be longer than the payload needed to register the watch. A malicious
    guest that registers a watch using a very large tag (i.e., with a registration operation
    payload length close to the 4096 byte limit) can cause the generation of watch events with
    a payload length larger than 4096 bytes, by writing to Xenstore entries below the watched
    path. This will result in an error condition in xenstored. This error can result in a NULL
    pointer dereference, leading to a crash of xenstored. A malicious guest administrator can
    cause xenstored to crash, leading to a denial of service. Following a xenstored crash,
    domains may continue to run, but management operations will be impossible. Only C
    xenstored is affected, oxenstored is not affected.

    An issue was discovered in Xen 4.6 through 4.14.x. When acting upon a guest
    XS_RESET_WATCHES request, not all tracking information is freed. A guest can cause
    unbounded memory usage in oxenstored. This can lead to a system-wide DoS. Only systems
    using the Ocaml Xenstored implementation are vulnerable. Systems using the C Xenstored
    implementation are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Nodes in xenstore have an ownership. In
    oxenstored, a owner could give a node away. However, node ownership has quota
    implications. Any guest can run another guest out of quota, or create an unbounded number
    of nodes owned by dom0, thus running xenstored out of memory A malicious guest
    administrator can cause a denial of service against a specific guest or against the whole
    host. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the
    default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems
    using C xenstored are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When they require assistance from the
    device model, x86 HVM guests must be temporarily de-scheduled. The device model will
    signal Xen when it has completed its operation, via an event channel, so that the relevant
    vCPU is rescheduled. If the device model were to signal Xen without having actually
    completed the operation, the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle would repeat. If, in
    addition, Xen is resignalled very quickly, the re-schedule may occur before the
    de-schedule was fully complete, triggering a shortcut. This potentially repeating process
    uses ordinary recursive function calls, and thus could result in a stack overflow. A
    malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest can cause Xen to crash, resulting in a
    Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are
    not affected. Only x86 stubdomains serving HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Recording of the per-vCPU control block
    mapping maintained by Xen and that of pointers into the control block is reversed. The
    consumer assumes, seeing the former initialized, that the latter are also ready for use.
    Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the
    entire system.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A bounds check common to most operation
    time functions specific to FIFO event channels depends on the CPU observing consistent
    state. While the producer side uses appropriately ordered writes, the consumer side isn't
    protected against re-ordered reads, and may hence end up de-referencing a NULL pointer.
    Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the
    entire system. Only Arm systems may be vulnerable. Whether a system is vulnerable depends
    on the specific CPU. x86 systems are not vulnerable.

  description: |
    The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names.
    One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function
    GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are
    equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an
    EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible
    denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two
    purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL
    distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp
    response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions
    TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items
    being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
    trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL
    then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a
    URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the
    certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have
    support for the "-crl_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this
    attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means
    that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of
    EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's
    parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
    affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been
    checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x
    (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

    When reading SMTP server status codes, Thunderbird writes an integer value to a position
    on the stack that is intended to contain just one byte. Depending on processor
    architecture and stack layout, this leads to stack corruption that may be exploitable.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.5.1.

  description: |
    A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8 where an attacker
    controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger
    a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is
    recommended to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. If one cannot update, we
    recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose chunk
    size limits.

    url::recvline in url.cpp in libproxy 0.4.x through 0.4.15 allows a remote HTTP server to
    trigger uncontrolled recursion via a response composed of an infinite stream that lacks a
    newline character. This leads to stack exhaustion.

    url.cpp in libproxy through 0.4.15 is prone to a buffer overflow when PAC is enabled, as
    demonstrated by a large PAC file that is delivered without a Content-length header.

    Side-channel information leakage in graphics in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.66
    allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.

    A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events
    to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS
    vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our
    built-in sanitizer. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and
    Thunderbird < 78.5.

    It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the
    security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the
    user. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event
    handlers and therefore lead to XSS. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR <
    78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was
    intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script
    inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed
    object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird <
    78.5.

    If the Compact() method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated
    without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird <
    78.5.

    When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from
    the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4
    address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to
    a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR <
    78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a
    password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a
    software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that
    feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change
    and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    Side-channel information leakage in graphics in Google Chrome prior to 87.0.4280.66
    allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.

    A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events
    to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS
    vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our
    built-in sanitizer. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and
    Thunderbird < 78.5.

    It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the
    security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the
    user. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event
    handlers and therefore lead to XSS. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR <
    78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was
    intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script
    inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed
    object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird <
    78.5.

    If the Compact() method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated
    without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird <
    78.5.

    When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from
    the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4
    address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to
    a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR <
    78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a
    password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a
    software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that
    feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change
    and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.

  description: |
    An ACL bypass flaw was found in pacemaker. An attacker having a local account on the
    cluster and in the haclient group could use IPC communication with various daemons
    directly to perform certain tasks that they would be prevented by ACLs from doing if they
    went through the configuration.

    MoinMoin is a wiki engine. In MoinMoin before version 1.9.11, an attacker with write
    permissions can upload an SVG file that contains malicious javascript. This javascript
    will be executed in a user's browser when the user is viewing that SVG file on the wiki.
    Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version. MoinMoin Wiki 1.9.11 has the
    necessary fixes and also contains other important fixes.

    The cache action in action/cache.py in MoinMoin through 1.9.10 allows directory traversal
    through a crafted HTTP request. An attacker who can upload attachments to the wiki can use
    this to achieve remote code execution.

    that - for a short time period - allows local unprivileged users to create a connection to
    the X server without providing proper authentication. A local attacker can thus access X
    server display contents and, for example, intercept keystrokes or access the clipboard.
    This is caused by a race condition during Xauthority file creation.

  description: |
    Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method of the
    D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The
    impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for
    versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is
    enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the
    `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the
    shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client
    (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can
    e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems
    with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by
    passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in 2.1.4 and master
    that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of
    network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make
    sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the
    `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root
    anyway in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81
    and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.4, Firefox < 82, and Thunderbird < 78.4.

    Use after free in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 86.0.4240.75 allowed a remote attacker
    to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

  description: |
    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81
    and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.4, Firefox < 82, and Thunderbird < 78.4.

    Use after free in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 86.0.4240.75 allowed a remote attacker
    to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

  description: |
    A flaw was found in the mysql-wsrep component of mariadb. Lack of input sanitization in
    `wsrep_sst_method` allows for command injection that can be exploited by a remote attacker
    to execute arbitrary commands on galera cluster nodes. This threatens the system's
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This flaw affects mariadb versions before
    10.1.47, before 10.2.34, before 10.3.25, before 10.4.15 and before 10.5.6.

  description: |
    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

    Firefox sometimes ran the onload handler for SVG elements that the DOM sanitizer decided
    to remove, resulting in JavaScript being executed after pasting attacker-controlled data
    into a contenteditable element. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird <
    78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

    By exploiting an Open Redirect vulnerability on a website, an attacker could have spoofed
    the site displayed in the download file dialog to show the original site (the one
    suffering from the open redirect) rather than the site the file was actually downloaded
    from. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

    When recursing through graphical layers while scrolling, an iterator may have become
    invalid, resulting in a potential use-after-free. This occurs because the function
    APZCTreeManager::ComputeClippedCompositionBounds did not follow iterator invalidation
    rules. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR <
    78.3.

  description: |
    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. The PCI passthrough code improperly uses
    register data. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling have been identified that act on
    unsanitized values read back from device hardware registers. While devices strictly
    compliant with PCI specifications shouldn't be able to affect these registers, experience
    shows that it's very common for devices to have out-of-spec "backdoor" operations that can
    affect the result of these reads. A not fully trusted guest may be able to crash Xen,
    leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. Privilege escalation and
    information leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen supporting PCI passthrough are
    affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only guests
    with passed through PCI devices may be able to leverage the vulnerability. Only systems
    passing through devices with out-of-spec ("backdoor") functionality can cause issues.
    Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality is common; unless you have reason to
    believe that your device does not have such functionality, it's better to assume that it
    does.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. x86 PV guest kernels can experience denial
    of service via SYSENTER. The SYSENTER instruction leaves various state sanitization
    activities to software. One of Xen's sanitization paths injects a #GP fault, and
    incorrectly delivers it twice to the guest. This causes the guest kernel to observe a
    kernel-privilege #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege #GP fault
    (usually converted into SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can crash the guest
    kernel, resulting in a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from 3.2 onwards are
    vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platforms are not vulnerable. Only x86
    systems that support the SYSENTER instruction in 64bit mode are vulnerable. This is
    believed to be Intel, Centaur, and Shanghai CPUs. AMD and Hygon CPUs are not believed to
    be vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 PVH / HVM guests
    cannot exploit the vulnerability.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of the constraint that
    once-valid event channels may not turn invalid. Logic in the handling of event channel
    operations in Xen assumes that an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over
    the life time of a guest. However, operations like the resetting of all event channels may
    involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity. This may lead to
    bug checks triggering, crashing the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen,
    leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4
    onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only systems with
    untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are
    vulnerable. This number depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86 PV
    guests, this is 1023; for 64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM guests, this number is
    4095. Systems where untrusted guests are limited to fewer than this number are not
    vulnerable. Note that xl and libxl limit max_event_channels to 1023 by default, so systems
    using exclusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or their own toolstack based on libxl, and not
    explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are evtchn_reset() race conditions.
    Uses of EVTCHNOP_reset (potentially by a guest on itself) or XEN_DOMCTL_soft_reset (by
    itself covered by XSA-77) can lead to the violation of various internal assumptions. This
    may lead to out of bounds memory accesses or triggering of bug checks. In particular, x86
    PV guests may be able to elevate their privilege to that of the host. Host and guest
    crashes are also possible, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leaks cannot
    be ruled out. All Xen versions from 4.5 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.4 and
    earlier are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Out of bounds event channels are available
    to 32-bit x86 domains. The so called 2-level event channel model imposes different limits
    on the number of usable event channels for 32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either
    bitness) ones. 32-bit x86 domains can use only 1023 channels, due to limited space in
    their shared (between guest and Xen) information structure, whereas all other domains can
    use up to 4095 in this model. The recording of the respective limit during domain
    initialization, however, has occurred at a time where domains are still deemed to be
    64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respective domain properties. At the point domains
    get recognized as 32-bit ones, the limit didn't get updated accordingly. Due to this
    misbehavior in Xen, 32-bit domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may
    observe event channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail. Subsequent use
    of such event channels would then possibly lead to corruption of other parts of the shared
    info structure. An unprivileged guest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0, to
    misbehave. This may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen
    versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable.
    Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains are vulnerable. Arm systems, as well as
    x86 64-bit domains, are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a lack of preemption in
    evtchn_reset() / evtchn_destroy(). In particular, the FIFO event channel model allows
    guests to have a large number of event channels active at a time. Closing all of these
    (when resetting all event channels or when cleaning up after the guest) may take extended
    periods of time. So far, there was no arrangement for preemption at suitable intervals,
    allowing a CPU to spend an almost unbounded amount of time in the processing of these
    operations. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
    affecting the entire system. All Xen versions are vulnerable in principle. Whether
    versions 4.3 and older are vulnerable depends on underlying hardware characteristics.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. An x86 PV guest can trigger a host OS crash
    when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. When a guest accesses certain Model
    Specific Registers, Xen first reads the value from hardware to use as the basis for
    auditing the guest access. For the MISC_ENABLE MSR, which is an Intel specific MSR, this
    MSR read is performed without error handling for a #GP fault, which is the consequence of
    trying to read this MSR on non-Intel hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guest administrator
    can crash Xen, resulting in a host Denial of Service. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM
    systems are not vulnerable. Only Xen versions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and
    earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR
    (0x1a0) are vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are
    vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable. Other
    manufacturers have not been checked. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86
    HVM/PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing memory barriers when
    accessing/allocating an event channel. Event channels control structures can be accessed
    lockless as long as the port is considered to be valid. Such a sequence is missing an
    appropriate memory barrier (e.g., smp_*mb()) to prevent both the compiler and CPU from
    re-ordering access. A malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in
    a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.
    Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. Whether a system is vulnerable will
    depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen. For all systems, the presence and the
    scope of the vulnerability depend on the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler
    used to build Xen. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say
    which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code generation options). GCC
    documentation clearly suggests that re-ordering is possible. Arm systems will also be
    vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory access. Please consult your CPU vendor.
    x86 systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a race condition when migrating
    timers between x86 HVM vCPUs. When migrating timers of x86 HVM guests between its vCPUs,
    the locking model used allows for a second vCPU of the same guest (also operating on the
    timers) to release a lock that it didn't acquire. The most likely effect of the issue is a
    hang or crash of the hypervisor, i.e., a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are
    affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 HVM
    guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV and PVH cannot leverage the vulnerability.
    Only guests with more than one vCPU can exploit the vulnerability.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

    Firefox sometimes ran the onload handler for SVG elements that the DOM sanitizer decided
    to remove, resulting in JavaScript being executed after pasting attacker-controlled data
    into a contenteditable element. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird <
    78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

    By exploiting an Open Redirect vulnerability on a website, an attacker could have spoofed
    the site displayed in the download file dialog to show the original site (the one
    suffering from the open redirect) rather than the site the file was actually downloaded
    from. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.

    When recursing through graphical layers while scrolling, an iterator may have become
    invalid, resulting in a potential use-after-free. This occurs because the function
    APZCTreeManager::ComputeClippedCompositionBounds did not follow iterator invalidation
    rules. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR <
    78.3.

    In MediaWiki before 1.31.8, 1.32.x and 1.33.x before 1.33.4, and 1.34.x before 1.34.2,
    private wikis behind a caching server using the img_auth.php image authorization security
    feature may have had their files cached publicly, so any unauthorized user could view
    them. This occurs because Cache-Control and Vary headers were mishandled.

    Firejail through 0.9.62 does not honor the -- end-of-options indicator after the --output
    option, which may lead to command injection.

    Firejail through 0.9.62 mishandles shell metacharacters during use of the --output or
    --output-stderr option, which may lead to command injection.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki 1.34.x before 1.34.4. On Special:Contributions, the
    NS filter uses unescaped messages as keys in the option key for an HTMLForm specifier.
    This is vulnerable to a mild XSS if one of those messages is changed to include raw HTML.

    In MediaWiki before 1.31.10 and 1.32.x through 1.34.x before 1.34.4, Special:UserRights
    exposes the existence of hidden users.

    In MediaWiki before 1.31.10 and 1.32.x through 1.34.x before 1.34.4, XSS related to jQuery
    can occur. The attacker creates a message with [javascript:payload xss] and turns it into
    a jQuery object with mw.message().parse(). The expected result is that the jQuery object
    does not contain an <a> tag (or it does not have a href attribute, or it's empty, etc.).
    The actual result is that the object contains an <a href ="javascript... that executes
    when clicked.

    An issue was discovered in the OATHAuth extension in MediaWiki before 1.31.10 and 1.32.x
    through 1.34.x before 1.34.4. For Wikis using OATHAuth on a farm/cluster (such as via
    CentralAuth), rate limiting of OATH tokens is only done on a single site level. Thus,
    multiple requests can be made across many wikis/sites concurrently.

    An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.10 and 1.32.x through 1.34.x before
    1.34.4. The non-jqueryMsg version of mw.message().parse() doesn't escape HTML. This
    affects both message contents (which are generally safe) and the parameters (which can be
    based on user input). (When jqueryMsg is loaded, it correctly accepts only whitelisted
    tags in message contents, and escapes all parameters. Situations with an unloaded
    jqueryMsg are rare in practice, but can for example occur for Special:SpecialPages on a
    wiki with no extensions installed.)

    A client side enforcement of server side security vulnerability exists in rails < 5.2.4.2
    and rails < 6.0.3.1 ActiveStorage's S3 adapter that allows the Content-Length of a direct
    file upload to be modified by an end user bypassing upload limits.

    A deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability exists in rails < 5.2.4.3, rails <
    6.0.3.1 which can allow an attacker to supply information can be inadvertently leaked
    fromStrong Parameters.

    A deserialization of untrusted data vulnernerability exists in rails < 5.2.4.3, rails <
    6.0.3.1 that can allow an attacker to unmarshal user-provided objects in MemCacheStore and
    RedisCacheStore potentially resulting in an RCE.

    A CSRF forgery vulnerability exists in rails < 5.2.5, rails < 6.0.4 that makes it possible
    for an attacker to, given a global CSRF token such as the one present in the
    authenticity_token meta tag, forge a per-form CSRF token.

    A CSRF vulnerability exists in rails <= 6.0.3 rails-ujs module that could allow attackers
    to send CSRF tokens to wrong domains.

    In Action View before versions 5.2.4.4 and 6.0.3.3 there is a potential Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Action View's translation helpers. Views that allow the
    user to control the default (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be
    susceptible to XSS attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a
    missing translation key named html or ending in _html, the default string is incorrectly
    marked as HTML-safe and not escaped. This is patched in versions 6.0.3.3 and 5.2.4.4. A
    workaround without upgrading is proposed in the source advisory.

    ** DISPUTED ** Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial of service via a
    special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports "Trustwave has signaled they are disputing
    our claims." The CVE suggests that there is a security issue with how ModSecurity handles
    regular expressions that can result in a Denial of Service condition. The vendor does not
    consider this as a security issue because1) there is no default configuration issue here.
    An attacker would need to know that a rule using a potentially problematic regular
    expression was in place, 2) the attacker would need to know the basic nature of the
    regular expression itself to exploit any resource issues. It's well known that regular
    expression usage can be taxing on system resources regardless of the use case. It is up to
    the administrator to decide on when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential
    security benefit.

    In QEMU through 5.0.0, an integer overflow was found in the SM501 display driver
    implementation. This flaw occurs in the COPY_AREA macro while handling MMIO write
    operations through the sm501_2d_engine_write() callback. A local attacker could abuse this
    flaw to crash the QEMU process in sm501_2d_operation() in hw/display/sm501.c on the host,
    resulting in a denial of service.

    An out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator of the QEMU in
    versions before 5.2.0. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when
    USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out
    routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial
    of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU
    process on the host.

    hw/net/xgmac.c in the XGMAC Ethernet controller in QEMU before 07-20-2020 has a buffer
    overflow. This occurs during packet transmission and affects the highbank and midway
    emulated machines. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process
    on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential privileged code execution. This
    was fixed in commit 5519724a13664b43e225ca05351c60b4468e4555.

    In QEMU through 5.0.0, an assertion failure can occur in the network packet processing.
    This issue affects the e1000e and vmxnet3 network devices. A malicious guest user/process
    could use this flaw to abort the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
    service condition in net_tx_pkt_add_raw_fragment in hw/net/net_tx_pkt.c.

    In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.41, mod_proxy_ftp may use uninitialized memory when
    proxying to a malicious FTP server.

    Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted value for the

    By holding a reference to the eval() function from an about:blank window, a malicious
    webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to
    prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result
    in an unintended or malicious extension being installed. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 80, Thunderbird < 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, Firefox ESR <
    78.2, and Firefox for Android < 80.

    When aborting an operation, such as a fetch, an abort signal may be deleted while alerting
    the objects to be notified. This results in a use-after-free and we presume that with
    enough effort it could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 68.12 and Thunderbird < 68.12.

    In ISC BIND9 versions BIND 9.11.14 -> 9.11.19, BIND 9.14.9 -> 9.14.12, BIND 9.16.0 ->
    9.16.3, BIND Supported Preview Edition 9.11.14-S1 -> 9.11.19-S1: Unless a nameserver is
    providing authoritative service for one or more zones and at least one zone contains an
    empty non-terminal entry containing an asterisk ("*") character, this defect cannot be
    encountered. A would-be attacker who is allowed to change zone content could theoretically
    introduce such a record in order to exploit this condition to cause denial of service,
    though we consider the use of this vector unlikely because any such attack would require a
    significant privilege level and be easily traceable.

    In BIND 9.0.0 -> 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -> 9.17.3, also affects 9.9.3-S1 ->
    9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, An attacker on the network path for a
    TSIG-signed request, or operating the server receiving the TSIG-signed request, could send
    a truncated response to that request, triggering an assertion failure, causing the server
    to exit. Alternately, an off-path attacker would have to correctly guess when a
    TSIG-signed request was sent, along with other characteristics of the packet and message,
    and spoof a truncated response to trigger an assertion failure, causing the server to
    exit.

    In BIND 9.10.0 -> 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -> 9.17.3, also affects 9.10.5-S1 ->
    9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, An attacker that can reach a
    vulnerable system with a specially crafted query packet can trigger a crash. To be
    vulnerable, the system must: * be running BIND that was built with
    "--enable-native-pkcs11" * be signing one or more zones with an RSA key * be able to
    receive queries from a possible attacker

    In BIND 9.9.12 -> 9.9.13, 9.10.7 -> 9.10.8, 9.11.3 -> 9.11.21, 9.12.1 -> 9.16.5, 9.17.0 ->

    Supported Preview Edition, An attacker who has been granted privileges to change a
    specific subset of the zone's content could abuse these unintended additional privileges
    to update other contents of the zone.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to incorrect data
    validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
    This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to
    bypass local security and poison the proxy cache and any downstream caches with content
    from an arbitrary source. When configured for relaxed header parsing (the default), Squid
    relays headers containing whitespace characters to upstream servers. When this occurs as a
    prefix to a Content-Length header, the frame length specified will be ignored by Squid
    (allowing for a conflicting length to be used from another Content-Length header) but
    relayed upstream.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due to incorrect data
    validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
    This leads to cache poisoning. This allows any client, including browser scripts, to
    bypass local security and poison the browser cache and any downstream caches with content
    from an arbitrary source. Squid uses a string search instead of parsing the
    Transfer-Encoding header to find chunked encoding. This allows an attacker to hide a
    second request inside Transfer-Encoding: it is interpreted by Squid as chunked and split
    out into a second request delivered upstream. Squid will then deliver two distinct
    responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches.

    Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4 allows a trusted peer to perform Denial of Service
    by consuming all available CPU cycles during handling of a crafted Cache Digest response
    message. This only occurs when cache_peer is used with the cache digests feature. The
    problem exists because peerDigestHandleReply() livelocking in peer_digest.cc mishandles
    EOF.

  description: |
    By holding a reference to the eval() function from an about:blank window, a malicious
    webpage could have gained access to the InstallTrigger object which would allow them to
    prompt the user to install an extension. Combined with user confusion, this could result
    in an unintended or malicious extension being installed. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 80, Thunderbird < 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, Firefox ESR <
    78.2, and Firefox for Android < 80.

    When aborting an operation, such as a fetch, an abort signal may be deleted while alerting
    the objects to be notified. This results in a use-after-free and we presume that with
    enough effort it could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 68.12 and Thunderbird < 68.12.

    Use after free in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 81.0.4044.122 allowed a remote attacker
    to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

    Inappropriate implementation in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 84.0.4147.89 allowed an
    attacker in a privileged network position to potentially exploit heap corruption via a
    crafted SCTP stream.

    By observing the stack trace for JavaScript errors in web workers, it was possible to leak
    the result of a cross-origin redirect. This applied only to content that can be parsed as
    script. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 79, Firefox ESR < 68.11, Firefox ESR < 78.1,
    Thunderbird < 68.11, and Thunderbird < 78.1.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 78
    and Firefox ESR 78.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 79, Firefox ESR < 68.11, Firefox ESR < 78.1,
    Thunderbird < 68.11, and Thunderbird < 78.1.

    The xrdp-sesman service before version 0.9.13.1 can be crashed by connecting over port
    3350 and supplying a malicious payload. Once the xrdp-sesman process is dead, an
    unprivileged attacker on the server could then proceed to start their own imposter sesman
    service listening on port 3350. This will allow them to capture any user credentials that
    are submitted to XRDP and approve or reject arbitrary login credentials. For xorgxrdp
    sessions in particular, this allows an unauthorized user to hijack an existing session.
    This is a buffer overflow attack, so there may be a risk of arbitrary code execution as
    well.

  description: |
    Use after free in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 81.0.4044.122 allowed a remote attacker
    to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

    Inappropriate implementation in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 84.0.4147.89 allowed an
    attacker in a privileged network position to potentially exploit heap corruption via a
    crafted SCTP stream.

    By observing the stack trace for JavaScript errors in web workers, it was possible to leak
    the result of a cross-origin redirect. This applied only to content that can be parsed as
    script. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 79, Firefox ESR < 68.11, Firefox ESR < 78.1,
    Thunderbird < 68.11, and Thunderbird < 78.1.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 78
    and Firefox ESR 78.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 79, Firefox ESR < 68.11, Firefox ESR < 78.1,
    Thunderbird < 68.11, and Thunderbird < 78.1.

  description: |
    A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use the GRUB 2 flaw to
    hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flaw also allows the bypass of
    Secure Boot protections. In order to load an untrusted or modified kernel, an attacker
    would first need to establish access to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain
    the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a networked system with
    root access. With this access, an attacker could then craft a string to cause a buffer
    overflow by injecting a malicious payload that leads to arbitrary code execution within
    GRUB. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity
    as well as system availability.

    In grub2 versions before 2.06 the grub memory allocator doesn't check for possible
    arithmetic overflows on the requested allocation size. This leads the function to return
    invalid memory allocations which can be further used to cause possible integrity,
    confidentiality and availability impacts during the boot process.

    There's an issue with grub2 in all versions before 2.06 when handling squashfs filesystems
    containing a symbolic link with name length of UINT32 bytes in size. The name size leads
    to an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-size allocation further causing a heap-based
    buffer overflow with attacker controlled data.

    There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read_section_as_string(). It
    expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it
    before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker
    may leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX,
    leading to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and
    further heap-based buffer overflow.

    There is an issue with grub2 before version 2.06 while handling symlink on ext
    filesystems. A filesystem containing a symbolic link with an inode size of UINT32_MAX
    causes an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-sized memory allocation with subsequent
    heap-based buffer overflow.

    GRUB2 contains a race condition in grub_script_function_create() leading to a
    use-after-free vulnerability which can be triggered by redefining a function whilst the
    same function is already executing, leading to arbitrary code execution and secure boot
    restriction bypass. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.

    Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd and grub_initrd_init in
    the efilinux component of GRUB2, as shipped in Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu (the
    functionality is not included in GRUB2 upstream), leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
    These could be triggered by an extremely large number of arguments to the initrd command
    on 32-bit architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on any
    architecture. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure
    Boot restrictions. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.

    In Sanitize (RubyGem sanitize) greater than or equal to 3.0.0 and less than 5.2.1, there
    is a cross-site scripting vulnerability. When HTML is sanitized using Sanitize's "relaxed"
    config, or a custom config that allows certain elements, some content in a math or svg
    element may not be sanitized correctly even if math and svg are not in the allowlist. You
    are likely to be vulnerable to this issue if you use Sanitize's relaxed config or a custom
    config that allows one or more of the following HTML elements: iframe, math, noembed,
    noframes, noscript, plaintext, script, style, svg, xmp. Using carefully crafted input, an
    attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML through Sanitize, potentially resulting in

    An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of
    the QEMU emulator. This flaw occurs in the icmp6_send_echoreply() routine while replying
    to an ICMP echo request, also known as ping. This flaw allows a malicious guest to leak
    the contents of the host memory, resulting in possible information disclosure. This flaw
    affects versions of libslirp before 4.3.1.

    In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, es1370_transfer_audio in hw/audio/es1370.c does not properly
    validate the frame count, which allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access
    during an es1370_write() operation.

    In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, megasas_lookup_frame in hw/scsi/megasas.c has an out-of-bounds
    read via a crafted reply_queue_head field from a guest OS user.

    address_space_map in exec.c in QEMU 4.2.0 can trigger a NULL pointer dereference related
    to BounceBuffer.

    hw/pci/msix.c in QEMU 4.2.0 allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access via a
    crafted address in an msi-x mmio operation.

    rom_copy() in hw/core/loader.c in QEMU 4.0 and 4.1.0 does not validate the relationship
    between two addresses, which allows attackers to trigger an invalid memory copy operation.

    When using Apache Tomcat versions 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M4, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.34, 8.5.0 to
    8.5.54 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.103 if a) an attacker is able to control the contents and name of
    a file on the server; and b) the server is configured to use the PersistenceManager with a
    FileStore; and c) the PersistenceManager is configured with
    sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="null" (the default unless a SecurityManager is used)
    or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized; and
    d) the attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location used by FileStore
    to the file the attacker has control over; then, using a specifically crafted request, the
    attacker will be able to trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file
    under their control. Note that all of conditions a) to d) must be true for the attack to
    succeed.

    A specially crafted sequence of HTTP/2 requests sent to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to
    10.0.0-M5, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.35 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.55 could trigger high CPU usage for several
    seconds. If a sufficient number of such requests were made on concurrent HTTP/2
    connections, the server could become unresponsive.

    An h2c direct connection to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M6, 9.0.0.M5 to 9.0.36 and
    8.5.1 to 8.5.56 did not release the HTTP/1.1 processor after the upgrade to HTTP/2. If a
    sufficient number of such requests were made, an OutOfMemoryException could occur leading
    to a denial of service.

    The payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated in Apache Tomcat
    10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.36, 8.5.0 to 8.5.56 and 7.0.27 to 7.0.104. Invalid
    payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests with invalid payload
    lengths could lead to a denial of service.

    In Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.46, several cryptographic primitives had
    missing length checks. In cases where the application calling the library did not perform
    a sanity check on the inputs it could result in a crash due to a buffer overflow.

    After a HelloRetryRequest has been sent, the client may negotiate a lower protocol that
    TLS 1.3, resulting in an invalid state transition in the TLS State Machine. If the client
    gets into this state, incoming Application Data records will be ignored. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 72.

    NSS has shown timing differences when performing DSA signatures, which was exploitable and
    could eventually leak private keys. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.9.0,
    Firefox < 77, and Firefox ESR < 68.9.

    During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of the Binary Extended
    Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly input-dependent flow. This allowed an
    attacker able to perform electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces
    leading to the recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox browser does
    not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not affected, but products built on top
    of it might. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 78.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial
    of service or possibly gain privileges because of missing memory barriers in read-write
    unlock paths. The read-write unlock paths don't contain a memory barrier. On Arm, this
    means a processor is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding ones. In
    other words, the unlock may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesses
    within the "critical" section. As a consequence, it may be possible to have a writer
    executing a critical section at the same time as readers or another writer. In other
    words, many of the assumptions (e.g., a variable cannot be modified after a check) in the
    critical sections are not safe anymore. The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such
    as grant-table ones), so a malicious guest could exploit the race. For instance, there is
    a small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used concurrently.
    A malicious guest may be able to leak memory, or cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a
    Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.

    An issue was discovered in xenoprof in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users
    (without active profiling) to obtain sensitive information about other guests.
    Unprivileged guests can request to map xenoprof buffers, even if profiling has not been
    enabled for those guests. These buffers were not scrubbed.

    An issue was discovered in xenoprof in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users (with
    active profiling) to obtain sensitive information about other guests, cause a denial of
    service, or possibly gain privileges. For guests for which "active" profiling was enabled
    by the administrator, the xenoprof code uses the standard Xen shared ring structure.
    Unfortunately, this code did not treat the guest as a potential adversary: it trusts the
    guest not to modify buffer size information or modify head / tail pointers in unexpected
    ways. This can crash the host (DoS). Privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial
    of service because of bad continuation handling in GNTTABOP_copy. Grant table operations
    are expected to return 0 for success, and a negative number for errors. The fix for
    CVE-2017-12135 introduced a path through grant copy handling where success may be returned
    to the caller without any action taken. In particular, the status fields of individual
    operations are left uninitialised, and may result in errant behaviour in the caller of
    GNTTABOP_copy. A buggy or malicious guest can construct its grant table in such a way
    that, when a backend domain tries to copy a grant, it hits the incorrect exit path. This
    returns success to the caller without doing anything, which may cause crashes or other
    incorrect behaviour.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial
    of service because of a bad error path in GNTTABOP_map_grant. Grant table operations are
    expected to return 0 for success, and a negative number for errors. Some misplaced
    brackets cause one error path to return 1 instead of a negative value. The grant table
    code in Linux treats this condition as success, and proceeds with incorrectly initialised
    state. A buggy or malicious guest can construct its grant table in such a way that, when a
    backend domain tries to map a grant, it hits the incorrect error path. This will crash a
    Linux based dom0 or backend domain.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to cause a
    hypervisor crash. An inverted conditional in x86 HVM guests' dirty video RAM tracking code
    allows such guests to make Xen de-reference a pointer guaranteed to point at unmapped
    space. A malicious or buggy HVM guest may cause the hypervisor to crash, resulting in
    Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Xen versions from 4.8 onwards are
    affected. Xen versions 4.7 and earlier are not affected. Only x86 systems are affected.
    Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using shadow paging can leverage the
    vulnerability. In addition, there needs to be an entity actively monitoring a guest's
    video frame buffer (typically for display purposes) in order for such a guest to be able
    to leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV guests, as well as x86 HVM guests using hardware
    assisted paging (HAP), cannot leverage the vulnerability.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Arm guest OS users to cause a
    hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info. The
    hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared region with
    the hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly
    accessed. On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions that require a specific
    alignment. Unfortunately, there is no check that the address provided by the guest will be
    correctly aligned. As a result, a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by
    passing a misaligned address. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor
    crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm
    systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to
    cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of insufficient
    cache write-back under VT-d. When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to
    them require flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and hence
    prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs, a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory after changes
    were made. Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large
    page mappings into smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain
    read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another
    purpose. Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be
    ruled out. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are
    affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using
    hardware assisted paging (HAP), having a passed through PCI device assigned, and having
    page table sharing enabled can leverage the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing
    will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support
    compatible.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a host OS
    crash because of incorrect error handling in event-channel port allocation. The allocation
    of an event-channel port may fail for multiple reasons: (1) port is already in use, (2)
    the memory allocation failed, or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than what is
    supported by the ABI (e.g., 2L or FIFO) used by the guest or the limit set by an
    administrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due to the missing error checks, only (1)
    will be considered an error. All the other cases will provide a valid port and will result
    in a crash when trying to access the event channel. When the administrator configured a
    guest to allow more than 1023 event channels, that guest may be able to crash the host.
    When Xen is out-of-memory, allocation of new event channels will result in crashing the
    host rather than reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are affected. All
    architectures are affected. The default configuration, when guests are created with
    xl/libxl, is not vulnerable, because of the default event-channel limit.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Intel guest OS users to gain
    privileges or cause a denial of service because of non-atomic modification of a live EPT
    PTE. When mapping guest EPT (nested paging) tables, Xen would in some circumstances use a
    series of non-atomic bitfield writes. Depending on the compiler version and optimisation
    flags, Xen might expose a dangerous partially written PTE to the hardware, which an
    attacker might be able to race to exploit. A guest administrator or perhaps even an
    unprivileged guest user might be able to cause denial of service, data corruption, or
    privilege escalation. Only systems using Intel CPUs are vulnerable. Systems using AMD
    CPUs, and Arm systems, are not vulnerable. Only systems using nested paging (hap, aka
    nested paging, aka in this case Intel EPT) are vulnerable. Only HVM and PVH guests can
    exploit the vulnerability. The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on the
    precise optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen. If the compiler
    generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series of read-modify-write operations in
    the same order as the source code, the hypervisor is not vulnerable. For example, in one
    test build using GCC 8.3 with normal settings, the compiler generated multiple (unlocked)
    read-modify-write operations in source-code order, which did not constitute a
    vulnerability. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which
    compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code-generation options). The source
    code clearly violates the C rules, and thus should be considered vulnerable.

    In FFmpeg 4.1.3, there is a division by zero at adx_write_trailer in libavformat/rawenc.c.

    In FFmpeg before 4.2, avcodec_open2 in libavcodec/utils.c allows a NULL pointer
    dereference and possibly unspecified other impact when there is no valid close function
    pointer.

    FFmpeg before 4.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in vqa_decode_chunk because of an
    out-of-array access in vqa_decode_init in libavcodec/vqavideo.c.

    cbs_jpeg_split_fragment in libavcodec/cbs_jpeg.c in FFmpeg 4.1 and 4.2.2 has a heap-based
    buffer overflow during JPEG_MARKER_SOS handling because of a missing length check.

    FFmpeg 2.8 and 4.2.3 has a use-after-free via a crafted EXTINF duration in an m3u8 file
    because parse_playlist in libavformat/hls.c frees a pointer, and later that pointer is
    accessed in av_probe_input_format3 in libavformat/format.c.

    A CWE-125: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in long_term_filter function in
    g729postfilter.c in FFmpeg 4.2.1 during computation of the denominator of
    pseudo-normalized correlation R'(0), that could result in disclosure of information.

    FFmpeg 4.1.3 is affected by a Divide By Zero issue via libavcodec/ratecontrol.c, which
    allows a remote malicious user to cause a Denial of Service.

    The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7,
    and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar
    to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby.
    Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object
    within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.

    An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a
    victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the
    method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the
    buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive
    data from the interpreter.

  description: |
    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.31, 7.3.x below 7.3.18 and 7.4.x below 7.4.6, when HTTP
    file uploads are allowed, supplying overly long filenames or field names could lead PHP
    engine to try to allocate oversized memory storage, hit the memory limit and stop
    processing the request, without cleaning up temporary files created by upload request.
    This potentially could lead to accumulation of uncleaned temporary files exhausting the
    disk space on the target server.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3, when using
    file upload functionality, if upload progress tracking is enabled, but
    session.upload_progress.cleanup is set to 0 (disabled), and the file upload fails, the
    upload procedure would try to clean up data that does not exist and encounter null pointer
    dereference, which would likely lead to a crash.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3, when
    creating PHAR archive using PharData::buildFromIterator() function, the files are added
    with default permissions (0666, or all access) even if the original files on the
    filesystem were with more restrictive permissions. This may result in files having more
    lax permissions than intended when such archive is extracted.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.9, 7.3.x below 7.3.16 and 7.4.x below 7.4.4, while parsing
    EXIF data with exif_read_data() function, it is possible for malicious data to cause PHP
    to read one byte of uninitialized memory. This could potentially lead to information
    disclosure or crash.

    In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.16 and 7.4.x below 7.4.4, while using mb_strtolower()
    function with UTF-32LE encoding, certain invalid strings could cause PHP to overwrite
    stack-allocated buffer. This could lead to memory corruption, crashes and potentially code
    execution.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.29, 7.3.x below 7.3.16 and 7.4.x below 7.4.4, while using
    get_headers() with user-supplied URL, if the URL contains zero (\0) character, the URL
    will be silently truncated at it. This may cause some software to make incorrect
    assumptions about the target of the get_headers() and possibly send some information to a
    wrong server.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.30, 7.3.x below 7.3.17 and 7.4.x below 7.4.5, if PHP is
    compiled with EBCDIC support (uncommon), urldecode() function can be made to access
    locations past the allocated memory, due to erroneously using signed numbers as array
    indexes.

    Due to confusion about ValueTags on JavaScript Objects, an object may pass through the
    type barrier, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. *Note:
    this issue only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.* This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    Manipulating individual parts of a URL object could have caused an out-of-bounds read,
    leaking process memory to malicious JavaScript. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    When processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent process, the
    associated window may die; causing a use-after-free condition. This could have led to
    memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    When trying to connect to a STUN server, a race condition could have caused a
    use-after-free of a pointer, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird <
    68.10.0.

    When performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were
    rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have
    caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    If an attacker intercepts Thunderbird's initial attempt to perform automatic account setup
    using the Microsoft Exchange autodiscovery mechanism, and the attacker sends a crafted
    response, then Thunderbird sends username and password over https to a server controlled
    by the attacker. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

  description: |
    Due to confusion about ValueTags on JavaScript Objects, an object may pass through the
    type barrier, resulting in memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. *Note:
    this issue only affects Firefox on ARM64 platforms.* This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    Manipulating individual parts of a URL object could have caused an out-of-bounds read,
    leaking process memory to malicious JavaScript. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    When processing callbacks that occurred during window flushing in the parent process, the
    associated window may die; causing a use-after-free condition. This could have led to
    memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    When trying to connect to a STUN server, a race condition could have caused a
    use-after-free of a pointer, leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable
    crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird <
    68.10.0.

    When performing add-on updates, certificate chains terminating in non-built-in-roots were
    rejected (even if they were legitimately added by an administrator.) This could have
    caused add-ons to become out-of-date silently without notification to the user. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.10, Firefox < 78, and Thunderbird < 68.10.0.

    In ImageMagick before 7.0.8-25, a memory leak exists in ReadSIXELImage in coders/sixel.c.

    In ImageMagick before 7.0.8-25 and GraphicsMagick through 1.3.31, several memory leaks
    exist in WritePDFImage in coders/pdf.c.

    In ImageMagick before 7.0.8-25, a memory leak exists in WriteDIBImage in coders/dib.c.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.8-36 Q16, there is a memory leak in the function SVGKeyValuePairs of
    coders/svg.c, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted image
    file.

    The cineon parsing component in ImageMagick 7.0.8-26 Q16 allows attackers to cause a
    denial-of-service (uncontrolled resource consumption) by crafting a Cineon image with an
    incorrect claimed image size. This occurs because ReadCINImage in coders/cin.c lacks a
    check for insufficient image data in a file.

    ReadXWDImage in coders/xwd.c in the XWD image parsing component of ImageMagick 7.0.8-41
    Q16 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (divide-by-zero error) by crafting an
    XWD image file in which the header indicates neither LSB first nor MSB first.

    In ImageMagick 7.0.8-43 Q16, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function
    WriteTIFFImage of coders/tiff.c, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or

  description: |
    In coturn before version 4.5.1.3, there is an issue whereby STUN/TURN response buffer is
    not initialized properly. There is a leak of information between different client
    connections. One client (an attacker) could use their connection to intelligently query
    coturn to get interesting bytes in the padding bytes from the connection of another
    client. This has been fixed in 4.5.1.3.

    An exploitable heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the way CoTURN 4.5.1.1 web
    server parses POST requests. A specially crafted HTTP POST request can lead to information
    leaks and other misbehavior. An attacker needs to send an HTTPS request to trigger this
    vulnerability.

    In affected versions of WordPress, authenticated users with upload permissions (like
    authors) are able to inject JavaScript into some media file attachment pages in a certain
    way. This can lead to script execution in the context of a higher privileged user when the
    file is viewed by them. This has been patched in version 5.4.2, along with all the
    previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15,
    4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19, 4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31, 3.9.32, 3.8.34,
    3.7.34).

    In affected versions of WordPress, due to an issue in wp_validate_redirect() and URL
    sanitization, an arbitrary external link can be crafted leading to unintended/open
    redirect when clicked. This has been patched in version 5.4.2, along with all the
    previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15,
    4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19, 4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31, 3.9.32, 3.8.34,
    3.7.34).

    In affected versions of WordPress, when uploading themes, the name of the theme folder can
    be crafted in a way that could lead to JavaScript execution in /wp-admin on the themes
    page. This does require an admin to upload the theme, and is low severity self-XSS. This
    has been patched in version 5.4.2, along with all the previously affected versions via a
    minor release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15, 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19, 4.5.22,
    4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31, 3.9.32, 3.8.34, 3.7.34).

    In affected versions of WordPress, misuse of the `set-screen-option` filter's return value
    allows arbitrary user meta fields to be saved. It does require an admin to install a
    plugin that would misuse the filter. Once installed, it can be leveraged by low privileged
    users. This has been patched in version 5.4.2, along with all the previously affected
    versions via a minor release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15, 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19,
    4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31, 3.9.32, 3.8.34, 3.7.34).

    In wp-includes/comment-template.php in WordPress before 5.4.2, comments from a post or
    page could sometimes be seen in the latest comments even if the post or page was not
    public.

  description: |
    An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.13 and 3.0 before 3.0.7. In cases where a
    memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing malformed cache keys could
    result in a key collision, and potential data leakage.

    An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.13 and 3.0 before 3.0.7. Query parameters
    generated by the Django admin ForeignKeyRawIdWidget were not properly URL encoded, leading
    to a possibility of an XSS attack.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 76 and Firefox ESR 68.8.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 68.9.0, Firefox < 77, and Firefox ESR < 68.9.

    Mozilla Developer Iain Ireland discovered a missing type check during unboxed objects
    removal, resulting in a crash. We presume that with enough effort that it could be
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.9.0, Firefox
    < 77, and Firefox ESR < 68.9.

    When browsing a malicious page, a race condition in our SharedWorkerService could occur
    and lead to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.9.0, Firefox < 77, and Firefox ESR < 68.9.

    NSS has shown timing differences when performing DSA signatures, which was exploitable and
    could eventually leak private keys. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.9.0,
    Firefox < 77, and Firefox ESR < 68.9.

    If Thunderbird is configured to use STARTTLS for an IMAP server, and the server sends a
    PREAUTH response, then Thunderbird will continue with an unencrypted connection, causing
    email data to be sent without protection. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.9.0.

    GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.14 uses incorrect cryptography for encrypting a session ticket (a
    loss of confidentiality in TLS 1.2, and an authentication bypass in TLS 1.3). The earliest
    affected version is 3.6.4 (2018-09-24) because of an error in a 2018-09-18 commit. Until
    the first key rotation, the TLS server always uses wrong data in place of an encryption
    key derived from an application.

    napi_get_value_string_*() allows various kinds of memory corruption in node < 10.21.0,
    12.18.0, and < 14.4.0.

    In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes
    denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a
    SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and
    over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this
    vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement
    nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the
    number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.

    Firefox < 77, and Firefox ESR < 68.9.

    When browsing a malicious page, a race condition in our SharedWorkerService could occur
    and lead to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.9.0, Firefox < 77, and Firefox ESR < 68.9.

    Mozilla Developer Iain Ireland discovered a missing type check during unboxed objects
    removal, resulting in a crash. We presume that with enough effort that it could be
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.9.0, Firefox

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 76 and Firefox ESR 68.8.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough

  description: |
    A malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective limitation on the
    number of fetches performed when processing referrals can, through the use of specially
    crafted referrals, cause a recursing server to issue a very large number of fetches in an
    attempt to process the referral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance
    of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work required to
    perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this behavior to use the recursing
    server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.

    Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to
    reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a
    TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even
    on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND
    servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion

    A buffer overflow could occur when parsing and validating SCTP chunks in WebRTC. This
    could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76, and Thunderbird < 68.8.0.

    A race condition when running shutdown code for Web Worker led to a use-after-free
    vulnerability. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76, and Thunderbird < 68.8.0.

    The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP POST
    data of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as
    cURL' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in the
    disclosure of local files. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76,
    and Thunderbird < 68.8.0.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75
    and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76, and Thunderbird <
    68.8.0.

    By encoding Unicode whitespace characters within the From email header, an attacker can
    spoof the sender email address that Thunderbird displays. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 68.8.0.

    An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esi:when when ESI is
    enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to
    hold the expression while it's being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could
    either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new
    member, there is no check to ensure that the stack won't overflow.

    An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7 and 5. When receiving a request, Squid checks
    its cache to see if it can serve up a response. It does this by making a MD5 hash of the
    absolute URL of the request. If found, it servers the request. The absolute URL can
    include the decoded UserInfo (username and password) for certain protocols. This decoded
    info is prepended to the domain. This allows an attacker to provide a username that has
    special characters to delimit the domain, and treat the rest of the URL as a path or query
    string. An attacker could first make a request to their domain using an encoded username,
    then when a request for the target domain comes in that decodes to the exact URL, it will
    serve the attacker's HTML instead of the real HTML. On Squid servers that also act as
    reverse proxies, this allows an attacker to gain access to features that only reverse
    proxies can use, such as ESI.

    An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI
    elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements.
    When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a
    check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it's off by 1, leading to a Heap
    Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can't affect
    adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. When handling a URN request, a corresponding
    HTTP request is made. This HTTP request doesn't go through the access checks that incoming
    HTTP requests go through. This causes all access checks to be bypassed and allows access
    to restricted HTTP servers, e.g., an attacker can connect to HTTP servers that only listen
    on localhost.

    An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling requests from users, Squid
    checks its rules to see if the request should be denied. Squid by default comes with rules
    to block access to the Cache Manager, which serves detailed server information meant for
    the maintainer. This rule is implemented via url_regex. The handler for url_regex rules
    URL decodes an incoming request. This allows an attacker to encode their URL to bypass the
    url_regex check, and gain access to the blocked resource.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. URN response handling in Squid suffers from a
    heap-based buffer overflow. When receiving data from a remote server in response to an URN
    request, Squid fails to ensure that the response can fit within the buffer. This leads to
    attacker controlled data overflowing in the heap.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. It allows a crafted FTP server to trigger
    disclosure of sensitive information from heap memory, such as information associated with
    other users' sessions or non-Squid processes.

    An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect input
    validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial of Service to
    all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability occurring before
    normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy port can trivially
    perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme.

    An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8 when the append_domain setting is
    used (because the appended characters do not properly interact with hostname length
    restrictions). Due to incorrect message processing, it can inappropriately redirect
    traffic to origins it should not be delivered to.

    An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. It allows attackers to smuggle
    HTTP requests through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits the HTTP Request
    pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages corrupt caches (between a client and
    Squid) with attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated to
    software between the attacker client and Squid. There are no effects on Squid itself, nor
    on any upstream servers. The issue is related to a request header containing whitespace
    between a header name and a colon.

    An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect data
    management, it is vulnerable to information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest
    Authentication. Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that sits within heap
    memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR protections and may aid attackers
    isolating memory areas to target for remote code execution attacks.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. Due to incorrect input validation, it can
    interpret crafted HTTP requests in unexpected ways to access server resources prohibited
    by earlier security filters.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. Due to incorrect buffer management, a remote
    client can cause a buffer overflow in a Squid instance acting as a reverse proxy.

    An issue was discovered in Squid before 5.0.2. A remote attacker can replay a sniffed
    Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. This
    occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter (a short integer).
    Remote code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of
    replayed as valid credentials).

    The fix for CVE-2019-0199 was incomplete and did not address HTTP/2 connection window
    exhaustion on write in Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.19 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.40 . By
    not sending WINDOW_UPDATE messages for the connection window (stream 0) clients were able
    to cause server-side threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.

    When Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.28, 8.5.0 to 8.5.47, 7.0.0 and 7.0.97 is configured
    with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, a local attacker without access to the Tomcat
    process or configuration files is able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a
    man-in-the-middle attack to capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX
    interface. The attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and
    gain complete control over the Tomcat instance.

    When using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0 to 8.5.49 and
    7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session
    fixation attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but,
    erring on the side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.

    The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to
    7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid
    Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP
    Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled
    the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is
    considered unlikely.

    In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header
    parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP
    headers to be parsed as valid. This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if
    Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
    Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered
    unlikely.

    When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming
    connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than,
    for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker,
    they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to
    9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector
    enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and
    recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required.
    This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files
    from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP
    Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web
    application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by
    some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made
    remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required
    if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth
    approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP
    may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were
    made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default
    configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later
    will need to make small changes to their configurations.

  description: |
    An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any user
    authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an
    EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on
    a limited viewer role. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a
    project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global
    admin privileges.

    An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. The list of roles
    provided for an OAuth1 access token is silently ignored. Thus, when an access token is
    used to request a keystone token, the keystone token contains every role assignment the
    creator had for the project. This results in the provided keystone token having more role
    assignments than the creator intended, possibly giving unintended escalated access.

    An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any authenticated
    user can create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified
    role on, and then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to
    masquerade as another user. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin
    on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user
    global admin privileges.

    An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. The EC2 API
    doesn't have a signature TTL check for AWS Signature V4. An attacker can sniff the
    Authorization header, and then use it to reissue an OpenStack token an unlimited number of
    times.

    A buffer overflow could occur when parsing and validating SCTP chunks in WebRTC. This
    could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76, and Thunderbird < 68.8.0.

    A race condition when running shutdown code for Web Worker led to a use-after-free
    vulnerability. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76, and Thunderbird < 68.8.0.

    The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP POST
    data of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as
    cURL' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in the
    disclosure of local files. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76,
    and Thunderbird < 68.8.0.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 75
    and Firefox ESR 68.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.8, Firefox < 76, and Thunderbird <
    68.8.0.

    In affected versions of WordPress, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the
    navigation section of Customizer allows JavaScript code to be executed. Exploitation
    requires an authenticated user. This has been patched in version 5.4.1, along with all the
    previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.3, 5.2.6, 5.1.5, 5.0.9, 4.9.14,
    4.8.13, 4.7.17, 4.6.18, 4.5.21, 4.4.22, 4.3.23, 4.2.27, 4.1.30, 4.0.30, 3.9.31, 3.8.33,
    3.7.33).

    In affected versions of WordPress, files with a specially crafted name when uploaded to
    the Media section can lead to script execution upon accessing the file. This requires an
    authenticated user with privileges to upload files. This has been patched in version
    5.4.1, along with all the previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.3, 5.2.6,
    5.1.5, 5.0.9, 4.9.14, 4.8.13, 4.7.17, 4.6.18, 4.5.21, 4.4.22, 4.3.23, 4.2.27, 4.1.30,
    4.0.30, 3.9.31, 3.8.33, 3.7.33).

    In affected versions of WordPress, a password reset link emailed to a user does not expire
    upon changing the user password. Access would be needed to the email account of the user
    by a malicious party for successful execution. This has been patched in version 5.4.1,
    along with all the previously affected versions via a minor release (5.3.3, 5.2.6, 5.1.5,
    5.0.9, 4.9.14, 4.8.13, 4.7.17, 4.6.18, 4.5.21, 4.4.22, 4.3.23, 4.2.27, 4.1.30, 4.0.30,
    3.9.31, 3.8.33, 3.7.33).

    In affected versions of WordPress, some private posts, which were previously public, can
    result in unauthenticated disclosure under a specific set of conditions. This has been
    patched in version 5.4.1, along with all the previously affected versions via a minor
    release (5.3.3, 5.2.6, 5.1.5, 5.0.9, 4.9.14, 4.8.13, 4.7.17, 4.6.18, 4.5.21, 4.4.22,
    4.3.23, 4.2.27, 4.1.30, 4.0.30, 3.9.31, 3.8.33, 3.7.33).

    In affected versions of WordPress, a vulnerability in the stats() method of
    class-wp-object-cache.php can be exploited to execute cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    This has been patched in version 5.4.1, along with all the previously affected versions
    via a minor release (5.3.3, 5.2.6, 5.1.5, 5.0.9, 4.9.14, 4.8.13, 4.7.17, 4.6.18, 4.5.21,

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource record-parsing
    functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in mDNS
    messages, the compression pointer is followed without checking for recursion, leading to a
    denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.

    An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the label-parsing functionality of
    Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages, the
    rr_decode function's return value is not checked, leading to a double free that could be
    exploited to execute arbitrary code. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this
    vulnerability.

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the TXT record-parsing
    functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing the RDATA section in a TXT
    record in mDNS messages, multiple integer overflows can be triggered, leading to a denial
    of service. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability.

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality
    of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages, the implementation does not
    properly keep track of the available data in the message, possibly leading to an
    out-of-bounds read that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS
    message to trigger this vulnerability.

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality
    of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages in mdns_recv, the return value
    of the mdns_read_header function is not checked, leading to an uninitialized variable
    usage that eventually results in a null pointer dereference, leading to service crash. An
    attacker can send a series of mDNS messages to trigger this vulnerability.

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource allocation handling
    of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some
    allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via
    resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this
    vulnerability through decoding of the domain name performed by rr_decode.

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource allocation handling
    of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some
    allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via
    resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this
    vulnerability through the function rr_read_RR [5] reads the current resource record,
    except for the RDATA section. This is read by the loop at in rr_read. For each RR type, a
    different function is called. When the RR type is 0x10, the function rr_read_TXT is called
    at [6].

    An off-by-one error in the DecodeBlock function in codec/sdl_image.c in VideoLAN VLC media
    player before 3.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption) via a crafted image file. NOTE: this may be related to the SDL_Image product.

    requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They
    manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte
    chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU,
    memory, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles
    the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree.
    This can consume excess CPU.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request
    over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer.
    Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory,
    CPU, or both.

    Improper Certificate Validation in Node.js 10, 12, and 13 causes the process to abort when
    sending a crafted X.509 certificate

    HTTP request smuggling in Node.js 10, 12, and 13 causes malicious payload delivery when
    transfer-encoding is malformed

    Including trailing white space in HTTP header values in Nodejs 10, 12, and 13 causes
    bypass of authorization based on header value comparisons

    loop exit after 10k iterations so that it covers no-op opcodes as well.

    hw/display/bochs-display.c in QEMU 4.0.0 does not ensure a sufficient PCI config space
    allocation, leading to a buffer overflow involving the PCIe extended config space.

    QEMU 4.1.0 has a memory leak in zrle_compress_data in ui/vnc-enc-zrle.c during a VNC
    disconnect operation because libz is misused, resulting in a situation where memory
    allocated in deflateInit2 is not freed in deflateEnd.

    A use after free vulnerability in ip_reass() in ip_input.c of libslirp 4.2.0 and prior
    releases allows crafted packets to cause a denial of service.

    iscsi_aio_ioctl_cb in block/iscsi.c in QEMU 4.1.0 has a heap-based buffer over-read that

  description: |
    Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending
    private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This bug is similar to
    CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an
    exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git
    uses external "credential helper" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other
    credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs
    that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to
    send a "blank" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will
    interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password,
    leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by
    feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious;
    the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to
    the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the
    problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the
    ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use.
    Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's "store" helper -
    Git's "cache" helper - the "osxkeychain" helper that ships in Git's "contrib" directory
    Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git
    Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger
    the vulnerability.

    Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending
    private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external "credential
    helper" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage
    provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline
    can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the
    credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an
    HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in
    credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the
    relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present
    stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be
    triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather
    suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not
    visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The
    problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to
    v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit
    9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is
    sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are:
    2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.

  description: |
    Under certain conditions, when running the nsDocShell destructor, a race condition can
    cause a use-after-free. We are aware of targeted attacks in the wild abusing this flaw.
    This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox < 74.0.1, and Firefox ESR <
    68.6.1.

    Under certain conditions, when handling a ReadableStream, a race condition can cause a
    use-after-free. We are aware of targeted attacks in the wild abusing this flaw. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox < 74.0.1, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.1.

    When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's
    <code>copyTexSubImage</code> method, the specification requires the returned values be
    zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data
    disclosure. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox ESR < 68.7, and
    Firefox < 75.

    On 32-bit builds, an out of bounds write could have occurred when processing an image
    larger than 4 GB in <code>GMPDecodeData</code>. It is possible that with enough effort
    this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox ESR < 68.7, and Firefox < 75.

    Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported memory
    safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence
    of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox
    ESR < 68.7, and Firefox < 75.

  description: |
    When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's
    <code>copyTexSubImage</code> method, the specification requires the returned values be
    zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data
    disclosure. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox ESR < 68.7, and
    Firefox < 75.

    On 32-bit builds, an out of bounds write could have occurred when processing an image
    larger than 4 GB in <code>GMPDecodeData</code>. It is possible that with enough effort
    this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox ESR < 68.7, and Firefox < 75.

    Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported memory
    safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence
    of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been
    exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.7.0, Firefox
    ESR < 68.7, and Firefox < 75.

    GnuTLS 3.6.x before 3.6.13 uses incorrect cryptography for DTLS. The earliest affected
    version is 3.6.3 (2018-07-16) because of an error in a 2017-10-06 commit. The DTLS client
    always uses 32 '\0' bytes instead of a random value, and thus contributes no randomness to
    a DTLS negotiation. This breaks the security guarantees of the DTLS protocol.

    from heap corruption to stack corruption depending on the structure of the underlying

    path is not used for normal authentication, but only when the Kerberos library does
    supplemental prompting, such as with PKINIT or when using the non-standard no_prompt PAM

  description: |
    usrsctp before 2019-12-20 has out-of-bounds reads in sctp_load_addresses_from_init.

    When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could
    occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR
    < 68.6.

    By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read
    off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the
    <code>stream-reinit</code> task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed,
    causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP
    method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as
    Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command
    injection and arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6,
    Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name
    by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are
    able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox
    added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply
    'AirPods'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6,
    and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox and Thunderbird 68.5.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    usrsctp before 2019-12-20 has out-of-bounds reads in sctp_load_addresses_from_init.

    When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could
    occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR
    < 68.6.

    By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read
    off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the
    <code>stream-reinit</code> task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed,
    causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects
    Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP
    method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as
    Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command
    injection and arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6,
    Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name
    by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are
    able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox
    added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply
    'AirPods'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6,
    and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox and Thunderbird 68.5.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.

    There is a DoS vulnerability in Pillow before 6.2.2 caused by FpxImagePlugin.py calling
    the range function on an unvalidated 32-bit integer if the number of bands is large. On
    Windows running 32-bit Python, this results in an OverflowError or MemoryError due to the
    2 GB limit. However, on Linux running 64-bit Python this results in the process being
    terminated by the OOM killer.

    libImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has a PCX P mode buffer overflow.

    libImaging/FliDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has an FLI buffer overflow.

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0, PHP DirectoryIterator
    class accepts filenames with embedded \0 byte and treats them as terminating at that byte.
    This could lead to security vulnerabilities, e.g. in applications checking paths that the

    In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0, PHP bcmath extension
    functions on some systems, including Windows, can be tricked into reading beyond the
    allocated space by supplying it with string containing characters that are identified as
    numeric by the OS but aren't ASCII numbers. This can read to disclosure of the content of
    some memory locations.

    When PHP EXIF extension is parsing EXIF information from an image, e.g. via
    exif_read_data() function, in PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and
    7.4.0 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past the allocated
    buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.

    7.4.0 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past the allocated

    When using fgetss() function to read data with stripping tags, in PHP versions 7.2.x below
    7.2.27, 7.3.x below 7.3.14 and 7.4.x below 7.4.2 it is possible to supply data that will
    cause this function to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information
    disclosure or crash.

  description: |
    When deriving an identifier for an email message, uninitialized memory was used in
    addition to the message contents. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5.

    When processing an email message with an ill-formed envelope, Thunderbird could read data
    from a random memory location. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5.

    If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master password, an
    unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored
    password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in
    Thunderbird 60. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow
    the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 68.5.

    When processing a message that contains multiple S/MIME signatures, a bug in the MIME
    processing code caused a null pointer dereference, leading to an unexploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5.

    If a template tag was used in a select tag, the parser could be confused and allow
    JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the
    browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result.
    In general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because
    scripting is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or
    browser-like contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and
    Firefox < ESR68.5.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72
    and Firefox ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product
    because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or
    browser-like contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and
    Firefox < ESR68.5.

  description: |
    A flaw was found in PostgreSQL's "ALTER ... DEPENDS ON EXTENSION", where sub-commands did
    not perform authorization checks. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw in certain
    configurations to perform drop objects such as function, triggers, et al., leading to
    database corruption. This issue affects PostgreSQL versions before 12.2, before 11.7,
    before 10.12 and before 9.6.17.

  description: |
    A content process could have modified shared memory relating to crash reporting
    information, crash itself, and cause an out-of-bound write. This could have caused memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 73
    and Firefox < ESR68.5.

    If a template tag was used in a select tag, the parser could be confused and allow
    JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the
    browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result.
    In general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because
    scripting is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or
    browser-like contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and
    Firefox < ESR68.5.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72
    and Firefox ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary
    code. In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product
    because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or
    browser-like contexts. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.5, Firefox < 73, and
    Firefox < ESR68.5.

    _TIFFCheckMalloc and _TIFFCheckRealloc in tif_aux.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10 mishandle
    Integer Overflow checks because they rely on compiler behavior that is undefined by the
    applicable C standards. This can, for example, lead to an application crash.

    tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10, as used in GDAL through 3.0.1 and other
    products, has an integer overflow that potentially causes a heap-based buffer overflow via
    a crafted RGBA image, related to a "Negative-size-param" condition.

  description: |
    When pasting a &lt;style&gt; tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS
    sanitizer incorrectly rewrites a @namespace rule. This could allow for injection into
    certain types of websites resulting in data exfiltration. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    Due to a missing case handling object types, a type confusion vulnerability could occur,
    resulting in a crash. We presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    When pasting a &lt;style&gt; tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS
    sanitizer does not escape &lt; and &gt; characters. Because the resulting string is pasted
    directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into
    the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it
    to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were
    identified with this behavior, more may exist. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 71 and Firefox ESR 68.3.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    Incorrect alias information in IonMonkey JIT compiler for setting array elements could
    lead to a type confusion. We are aware of targeted attacks in the wild abusing this flaw.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4.1, Thunderbird < 68.4.1, and Firefox <
    72.0.1.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing Arm domU attackers to cause a
    denial of service (infinite loop) involving a LoadExcl or StoreExcl operation.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing Arm domU attackers to cause a
    denial of service (infinite loop) involving a compare-and-exchange operation.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service via a VCPUOP_initialise hypercall. hypercall_create_continuation() is a
    variadic function which uses a printf-like format string to interpret its parameters.
    Error handling for a bad format character was done using BUG(), which crashes Xen. One
    path, via the VCPUOP_initialise hypercall, has a bad format character. The BUG() can be
    hit if VCPUOP_initialise executes for a sufficiently long period of time for a
    continuation to be created. Malicious guests may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a
    Denial of Service (DoS). Xen versions 4.6 and newer are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.5 and
    earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. HVM and PVH
    guests, and guests on ARM systems, cannot exploit the vulnerability.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to gain host
    OS privileges by leveraging race conditions in pagetable promotion and demotion
    operations. There are issues with restartable PV type change operations. To avoid using
    shadow pagetables for PV guests, Xen exposes the actual hardware pagetables to the guest.
    In order to prevent the guest from modifying these page tables directly, Xen keeps track
    of how pages are used using a type system; pages must be "promoted" before being used as a
    pagetable, and "demoted" before being used for any other type. Xen also allows for
    "recursive" promotions: i.e., an operating system promoting a page to an L4 pagetable may
    end up causing pages to be promoted to L3s, which may in turn cause pages to be promoted
    to L2s, and so on. These operations may take an arbitrarily large amount of time, and so
    must be re-startable. Unfortunately, making recursive pagetable promotion and demotion
    operations restartable is incredibly complicated, and the code contains several races
    which, if triggered, can cause Xen to drop or retain extra type counts, potentially
    allowing guests to get write access to in-use pagetables. A malicious PV guest
    administrator may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host. All x86 systems
    with untrusted PV guests are vulnerable. HVM and PVH guests cannot exercise this
    vulnerability.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service or gain privileges by leveraging the erroneous enabling of interrupts.
    Interrupts are unconditionally unmasked in exception handlers. When an exception occurs on
    an ARM system which is handled without changing processor level, some interrupts are
    unconditionally enabled during exception entry. So exceptions which occur when interrupts
    are masked will effectively unmask the interrupts. A malicious guest might contrive to
    arrange for critical Xen code to run with interrupts erroneously enabled. This could lead
    to data corruption, denial of service, or possibly even privilege escalation. However a
    precise attack technique has not been identified.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service via a XENMEM_add_to_physmap hypercall. p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by
    the functions p2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check guest
    physical frame. The rest of the code in the two functions will assume that there is a
    valid root table and check that with BUG_ON(). The function p2m_get_root_pointer() will
    ignore the unused top bits of a guest physical frame. This means that the function
    p2m_set_entry() will alias the frame. However, p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated using
    the original frame. It would be possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a
    frame that would lead p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL in p2m_get_entry() and
    p2m_resolve_translation_fault(). Additionally, the sanity check on p2m->max_mapped_gfn is
    off-by-one allowing "highest mapped + 1" to be considered valid. However,
    p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL. The problem could be triggered with a specially
    crafted hypercall XENMEM_add_to_physmap{, _batch} followed by an access to an address (via
    hypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but cause p2m_get_root_pointer()
    to return NULL. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in
    a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen version 4.8 and newer are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are
    vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gain host OS
    privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain has access to a physical
    device. This occurs because passed through PCI devices may corrupt host memory after
    deassignment. When a PCI device is assigned to an untrusted domain, it is possible for
    that domain to program the device to DMA to an arbitrary address. The IOMMU is used to
    protect the host from malicious DMA by making sure that the device addresses can only
    target memory assigned to the guest. However, when the guest domain is torn down, or the
    device is deassigned, the device is assigned back to dom0, thus allowing any in-flight DMA
    to potentially target critical host data. An untrusted domain with access to a physical
    device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where
    guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are
    vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OS users to gain
    guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors. There is missing descriptor table
    limit checking in x86 PV emulation. When emulating certain PV guest operations, descriptor
    table accesses are performed by the emulating code. Such accesses should respect the guest
    specified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case. Without this,
    emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates would allow guest user mode
    to install and then use descriptors of their choice, as long as the guest kernel did not
    itself install an LDT. (Most OSes don't install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user
    mode can elevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from at least
    3.2 onwards are affected. Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage this vulnerability.
    HVM, PVH, as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability. Arm systems are
    unaffected.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 AMD HVM guest OS users to cause
    a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by triggering data-structure access during
    pagetable-height updates. When running on AMD systems with an IOMMU, Xen attempted to
    dynamically adapt the number of levels of pagetables (the pagetable height) in the IOMMU
    according to the guest's address space size. The code to select and update the height had
    several bugs. Notably, the update was done without taking a lock which is necessary for
    safe operation. A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to access data structures
    while they are being modified, causing Xen to crash. Privilege escalation is thought to be
    very difficult but cannot be ruled out. Additionally, there is a potential memory leak of
    4kb per guest boot, under memory pressure. Only Xen on AMD CPUs is vulnerable. Xen running
    on Intel CPUs is not vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only systems where guests
    are given direct access to physical devices are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI
    pass-through are not vulnerable. Only HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability. PV and PVH
    guests cannot. All versions of Xen with IOMMU support are vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service via degenerate chains of linear pagetables, because of an incorrect fix
    for CVE-2017-15595. "Linear pagetables" is a technique which involves either pointing a
    pagetable at itself, or to another pagetable of the same or higher level. Xen has limited
    support for linear pagetables: A page may either point to itself, or point to another
    pagetable of the same level (i.e., L2 to L2, L3 to L3, and so on). XSA-240 introduced an
    additional restriction that limited the "depth" of such chains by allowing pages to either
    *point to* other pages of the same level, or *be pointed to* by other pages of the same
    level, but not both. To implement this, we keep track of the number of outstanding times a
    page points to or is pointed to another page table, to prevent both from happening at the
    same time. Unfortunately, the original commit introducing this reset this count when
    resuming validation of a partially-validated pagetable, incorrectly dropping some
    "linear_pt_entry" counts. If an attacker could engineer such a situation to occur, they
    might be able to make loops or other arbitrary chains of linear pagetables, as described
    in XSA-240. A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause the hypervisor to crash, resulting in
    Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege escalation and information
    leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are
    affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability.
    x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability. Only systems which have enabled
    linear pagetables are vulnerable. Systems which have disabled linear pagetables, either by
    selecting CONFIG_PV_LINEAR_PT=n when building the hypervisor, or adding pv-linear-pt=false
    on the command-line, are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gain host OS
    privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain has access to a physical
    device (and assignable-add is not used), because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-18424.
    XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's "assignable-add" feature to prepare devices to be
    assigned to untrusted guests. Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required
    step for device assignment. The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki describes
    alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt uses its own ways as well.
    Hosts where these "alternate" methods are used will still leave the system in a vulnerable
    state after the device comes back from a guest. An untrusted domain with access to a
    physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems
    where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through)
    are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to gain host
    OS privileges by leveraging race conditions in pagetable promotion and demotion
    operations, because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-18421. XSA-299 addressed several
    critical issues in restartable PV type change operations. Despite extensive testing and
    auditing, some corner cases were missed. A malicious PV guest administrator may be able to
    escalate their privilege to that of the host. All security-supported versions of Xen are
    vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV
    guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the
    vulnerability. Note that these attacks require very precise timing, which may be difficult
    to exploit in practice.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit Arm guest OS users to cause
    a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) because certain bit iteration is mishandled. In
    a number of places bitmaps are being used by the hypervisor to track certain state.
    Iteration over all bits involves functions which may misbehave in certain corner cases: On
    32-bit Arm accesses to bitmaps with bit a count which is a multiple of 32, an out of
    bounds access may occur. A malicious guest may cause a hypervisor crash or hang, resulting
    in a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are vulnerable. 32-bit Arm systems are
    vulnerable. 64-bit Arm systems are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 guest OS users to cause a
    denial of service (infinite loop) because certain bit iteration is mishandled. In a number
    of places bitmaps are being used by the hypervisor to track certain state. Iteration over
    all bits involves functions which may misbehave in certain corner cases: On x86 accesses
    to bitmaps with a compile time known size of 64 may incur undefined behavior, which may in
    particular result in infinite loops. A malicious guest may cause a hypervisor crash or
    hang, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are vulnerable. x86
    systems with 64 or more nodes are vulnerable (there might not be any such systems that Xen
    would run on). x86 systems with less than 64 nodes are not vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 HVM/PVH guest OS users to cause
    a denial of service (guest OS crash) because VMX VMEntry checks mishandle a certain case.
    Please see XSA-260 for background on the MovSS shadow. Please see XSA-156 for background
    on the need for #DB interception. The VMX VMEntry checks do not like the exact combination
    of state which occurs when #DB in intercepted, Single Stepping is active, and blocked by
    STI/MovSS is active, despite this being a legitimate state to be in. The resulting VMEntry
    failure is fatal to the guest. HVM/PVH guest userspace code may be able to crash the
    guest, resulting in a guest Denial of Service. All versions of Xen are affected. Only
    systems supporting VMX hardware virtual extensions (Intel, Cyrix, or Zhaoxin CPUs) are
    affected. Arm and AMD systems are unaffected. Only HVM/PVH guests are affected. PV guests
    cannot leverage the vulnerability.

    TSX Asynchronous Abort condition on some CPUs utilizing speculative execution may allow an
    authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with
    local access.

    Improper invalidation for page table updates by a virtual guest operating system for
    multiple Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial
    of service of the host system via local access.

  description: |
    Incorrect alias information in IonMonkey JIT compiler for setting array elements could
    lead to a type confusion. We are aware of targeted attacks in the wild abusing this flaw.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4.1, Thunderbird < 68.4.1, and Firefox <
    72.0.1.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 71 and Firefox ESR 68.3.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    When pasting a &lt;style&gt; tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS
    sanitizer does not escape &lt; and &gt; characters. Because the resulting string is pasted
    directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into
    the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it
    to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were
    identified with this behavior, more may exist. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR <
    68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    Due to a missing case handling object types, a type confusion vulnerability could occur,
    resulting in a crash. We presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run
    arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    When pasting a &lt;style&gt; tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS
    sanitizer incorrectly rewrites a @namespace rule. This could allow for injection into
    certain types of websites resulting in data exfiltration. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.

    WordPress before 5.2.3 allows XSS in media uploads because wp_ajax_upload_attachment is
    mishandled.

    WordPress before 5.2.3 allows XSS in stored comments.

    WordPress before 5.2.3 allows XSS in shortcode previews.

    In WordPress before 5.2.3, validation and sanitization of a URL in wp_validate_redirect in
    wp-includes/pluggable.php could lead to an open redirect.

    WordPress before 5.2.3 allows reflected XSS in the dashboard.

    WordPress before 5.2.3 has an issue with URL sanitization in wp_kses_bad_protocol_once in
    wp-includes/kses.php that can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

    WordPress before 5.2.3 allows XSS in post previews by authenticated users.

    WordPress users with lower privileges (like contributors) can inject JavaScript code in
    the block editor using a specific payload, which is executed within the dashboard. This
    can lead to XSS if an admin opens the post in the editor. Execution of this attack does
    require an authenticated user. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all
    the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release. Automatic updates are
    enabled by default for minor releases and we strongly recommend that you keep them
    enabled.

    In WordPress before 5.3.1, authenticated users with lower privileges (like contributors)
    can inject JavaScript code in the block editor, which is executed within the dashboard. It
    can lead to an admin opening the affected post in the editor leading to XSS.

    WordPress before 5.2.4 has a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability because URL
    validation does not consider the interpretation of a name as a series of hex characters.

    In WordPress before 5.2.4, unauthenticated viewing of certain content is possible because
    the static query property is mishandled.

    WordPress before 5.2.4 is vulnerable to a stored XSS attack to inject JavaScript into
    STYLE elements.

    WordPress before 5.2.4 is vulnerable to poisoning of the cache of JSON GET requests
    because certain requests lack a Vary: Origin header.

    WordPress before 5.2.4 is vulnerable to stored XSS (cross-site scripting) via the
    Customizer.

    WordPress before 5.2.4 does not properly consider type confusion during validation of the
    referer in the admin pages, possibly leading to CSRF.

    wp_kses_bad_protocol in wp-includes/kses.php in WordPress before 5.3.1 mishandles the
    HTML5 colon named entity, allowing attackers to bypass input sanitization, as demonstrated
    by the javascript&colon; substring.

    In wp-includes/formatting.php in WordPress 3.7 to 5.3.0, the function
    wp_targeted_link_rel() can be used in a particular way to result in a stored cross-site
    scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1, along with all
    the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor release.

    In in wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/class-wp-rest-posts-controller.php in WordPress 3.7
    to 5.3.0, authenticated users who do not have the rights to publish a post are able to
    mark posts as sticky or unsticky via the REST API. For example, the contributor role does
    not have such rights, but this allowed them to bypass that. This has been patched in
    WordPress 5.3.1, along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a
    minor release.

    An error-handling flaw was found in python-ecdsa before version 0.13.3. During signature
    decoding, malformed DER signatures could raise unexpected exceptions (or no exceptions at
    all), which could lead to a denial of service.

    A flaw was found in all python-ecdsa versions before 0.13.3, where it did not correctly
    verify whether signatures used DER encoding. Without this verification, a malformed
    signature could be accepted, making the signature malleable. Without proper verification,
    an attacker could use a malleable signature to create false transactions.

    Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 mishandles path checking
    within File.fnmatch functions.

    WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth in Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x
    through 2.6.4 has a regular expression Denial of Service cause by looping/backtracking. A
    victim must expose a WEBrick server that uses DigestAuth to the Internet or a untrusted
    network.

    Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows HTTP Response
    Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an
    attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject
    malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix
    for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or
    an isolated LF.

    Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows code injection if
    the first argument (aka the "command" argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb
    is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.

    The plain text serializer used a fixed-size array for the number of <ol> elements it could
    process; however it was possible to overflow the static-sized array leading to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.

    When using nested workers, a use-after-free could occur during worker destruction. This
    resulted in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.

    Under certain conditions, when checking the Resist Fingerprinting preference during device
    orientation checks, a race condition could have caused a use-after-free and a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and
    Firefox < 71.

    Under certain conditions, when retrieving a document from a DocShell in the antitracking
    code, a race condition could cause a use-after-free condition and a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and
    Firefox < 71.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.

    In Apache SpamAssassin before 3.4.3, nefarious CF files can be configured to run system
    commands without any output or errors. With this, exploits can be injected in a number of
    scenarios. In addition to upgrading to SA 3.4.3, we recommend that users should only use
    update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places.

    In Apache SpamAssassin before 3.4.3, a message can be crafted in a way to use excessive
    resources. Upgrading to SA 3.4.3 as soon as possible is the recommended fix but details
    will not be shared publicly.

    A reflected XSS issue was discovered in DAViCal through 1.1.8. It echoes the action
    parameter without encoding. If a user visits an attacker-supplied link, the attacker can
    view all data the attacked user can view, as well as perform all actions in the name of
    the user. If the user is an administrator, the attacker can for example add a new admin
    user to gain full access to the application.

    A CSRF issue was discovered in DAViCal through 1.1.8. If an authenticated user visits an
    attacker-controlled webpage, the attacker can send arbitrary requests in the name of the
    user to the application. If the attacked user is an administrator, the attacker could for
    example add a new admin user.

    A stored XSS issue was discovered in DAViCal through 1.1.8. It does not adequately
    sanitize output of various fields that can be set by unprivileged users, making it
    possible for JavaScript stored in those fields to be executed by another (possibly
    privileged) user. Affected database fields include Username, Display Name, and Email.

  description: |
    The plain text serializer used a fixed-size array for the number of <ol> elements it could
    process; however it was possible to overflow the static-sized array leading to memory
    corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.

    When using nested workers, a use-after-free could occur during worker destruction. This
    resulted in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird <
    68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.

    Under certain conditions, when checking the Resist Fingerprinting preference during device
    orientation checks, a race condition could have caused a use-after-free and a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and
    Firefox < 71.

    Under certain conditions, when retrieving a document from a DocShell in the antitracking
    code, a race condition could cause a use-after-free condition and a potentially
    exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and
    Firefox < 71.

    Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2.
    Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough
    effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.

    An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.8.0 through 2.8.50, 3.4.0 through 3.4.34, 4.2.0
    through 4.2.11, and 4.3.0 through 4.3.7. If an application passes unvalidated user input
    as the file for which MIME type validation should occur, then arbitrary arguments are
    passed to the underlying file command. This is related to symfony/http-foundation (and
    symfony/mime in 4.3.x).

    In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD
    parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or
    XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69
    and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox
    incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated
    as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It
    could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters - enabling the use of
    entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it
    was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the
    now-cross-origin window. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and
    Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged JSONView
    object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be
    minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This
    resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a
    buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or
    more likely lead to a crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2,
    and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    When following the value's prototype chain, it was possible to retain a reference to a
    locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird <
    68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    A crafted S/MIME message consisting of an inner encryption layer and an outer SignedData
    layer was shown as having a valid digital signature, although the signer might have had no
    access to the contents of the encrypted message, and might have stripped a different
    signature from the encrypted message. Previous versions had only suppressed showing a
    digital signature for messages with an outer multipart/signed layer. This vulnerability
    affects Thunderbird < 68.1.1.

  description: |
    A buffer overflow in the fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex() function in
    lib/fribidi-bidi.c of GNU FriBidi through 1.0.7 allows an attacker to cause a denial of
    service or possibly execute arbitrary code by delivering crafted text content to a user,
    when this content is then rendered by an application that uses FriBidi for text layout
    calculations. Examples include any GNOME or GTK+ based application that uses Pango for
    text layout, as this internally uses FriBidi for bidirectional text layout. For example,
    the attacker can construct a crafted text file to be opened in GEdit, or a crafted IRC
    message to be viewed in HexChat.

  description: |
    When following the value's prototype chain, it was possible to retain a reference to a
    locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a
    potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird <
    68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a
    buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or
    more likely lead to a crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2,
    and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This
    resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged JSONView
    object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be
    minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it
    was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the
    now-cross-origin window. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and
    Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox
    incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated
    as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It
    could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters - enabling the use of
    entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69
    and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox < 70, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR < 68.2.

    In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD
    parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or
    XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

    Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side
    channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group
    using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible
    that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the
    parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to
    non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an
    ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the
    ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters
    with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance
    of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in
    OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).
    Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

    In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure
    of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be
    decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted
    message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle
    attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private
    RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info
    to decrypt. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l
    (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

    The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x through 2.8 are
    vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache
    access patterns when Brainpool curves are used. An attacker may be able to gain leaked
    information from a side-channel attack that can be used for full password recovery.

    hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrect indication of
    disconnection in certain situations because source address validation is mishandled. This
    is a denial of service that should have been prevented by PMF (aka management frame
    protection). The attacker must send a crafted 802.11 frame from a location that is within
    the 802.11 communications range.

    In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD
    parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or
    XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

    When processing certain files, PHP EXIF extension in versions 7.1.x below 7.1.29, 7.2.x
    below 7.2.18 and 7.3.x below 7.3.5 can be caused to read past allocated buffer in
    exif_process_IFD_TAG function. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.

    7.2.19 and 7.3.x below 7.3.6 may perform out-of-buffer read due to integer overflow when
    parsing MIME headers. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.

    exif_read_data() function, in PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.30, 7.2.x below 7.2.19 and
    7.3.x below 7.3.6 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past

    When PHP EXIF extension is parsing EXIF information from an image, e.g. via
    exif_read_data() function, in PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.31, 7.2.x below 7.2.21 and
    7.3.x below 7.3.8 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past
    the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.

    A use-after-free in onig_new_deluxe() in regext.c in Oniguruma 6.9.2 allows attackers to
    potentially cause information disclosure, denial of service, or possibly code execution by
    providing a crafted regular expression. The attacker provides a pair of a regex pattern
    and a string, with a multi-byte encoding that gets handled by onig_new_deluxe(). Oniguruma
    issues often affect Ruby, as well as common optional libraries for PHP and Rust.

    Encrypted S/MIME parts in a crafted multipart/alternative message can leak plaintext when
    included in a a HTML reply/forward. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.1 and
    Thunderbird < 60.9.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox
    68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to
    run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1,
    Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a
    combination of SVG filters and a &lt;canvas&gt; element due to an error in how same-origin
    policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation
    could allow for data theft. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1,
    Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft
    specification in some instances for the unload event, which restricts access to detailed
    timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin
    information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and
    Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    Some HTML elements, such as &lt;title&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;, can contain literal angle
    brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to
    .innerHTML on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it
    were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as
    strictly for these elements as it does for other elements. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR
    < 68.1.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is
    freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR <
    60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during
    conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR <
    60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    In Docker before 18.09.4, an attacker who is capable of supplying or manipulating the
    build path for the "docker build" command would be able to gain command execution. An
    issue exists in the way "docker build" processes remote git URLs, and results in command
    injection into the underlying "git clone" command, leading to code execution in the
    context of the user executing the "docker build" command. This occurs because git ref can
    be misinterpreted as a flag.

    In Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x
    before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug
    log. This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that
    includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack
    API if they resend the secret.

    In Docker 19.03.x before 19.03.1 linked against the GNU C Library (aka glibc), code
    injection can occur when the nsswitch facility dynamically loads a library inside a chroot
    that contains the contents of the container.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial
    of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to
    build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued,
    this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request
    over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer.
    Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory,
    CPU, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the
    RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty
    SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently
    this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a flood of empty frames, potentially leading
    to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and
    without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or
    PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack
    bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU.

    Apache Traffic Server is vulnerable to HTTP/2 setting flood attacks. Earlier versions of
    Apache Traffic Server didn't limit the number of setting frames sent from the client using
    the HTTP/2 protocol. Users should upgrade to Apache Traffic Server 7.1.7, 8.0.4, or later
    versions.

  description: |
    LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can be
    executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is
    intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python
    sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address
    CVE-2019-9852, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations
    on the file system could be executed by employing a URL encoding attack to defeat the path
    verification step. However this protection could be bypassed by taking advantage of a flaw
    in how LibreOffice assembled the final script URL location directly from components of the
    passed in path as opposed to solely from the sanitized output of the path verification
    step. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3
    versions prior to 6.3.1.

  description: |
    Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is
    possible to escape that sandbox by loading accounts.firefox.com in that process and
    forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the
    sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would
    restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered. This vulnerability affects Firefox
    ESR < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 68.1, and Firefox < 69.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox
    68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
    corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to
    run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1,
    Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a
    combination of SVG filters and a &lt;canvas&gt; element due to an error in how same-origin
    policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation
    could allow for data theft. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1,
    Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft
    specification in some instances for the unload event, which restricts access to detailed
    timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin
    information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and
    Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    Some HTML elements, such as &lt;title&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;, can contain literal angle
    brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to
    .innerHTML on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it
    were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as
    strictly for these elements as it does for other elements. This vulnerability affects
    Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR
    < 68.1.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is
    freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR <
    60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during
    conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This
    vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR <
    60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream
    prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker
    requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They
    manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte
    chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU,
    memory, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles
    the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree.
    This can consume excess CPU.

  description: |
    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data buffering,
    potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the
    peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer
    cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of
    requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses,
    this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.

    HTTP/2 (2.4.20 through 2.4.39) very early pushes, for example configured with
    "H2PushResource", could lead to an overwrite of memory in the pushing request's pool,
    leading to crashes. The memory copied is that of the configured push link header values,
    not data supplied by the client.

    In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18-2.4.39, using fuzzed network input, the http/2 session
    handling could be made to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.

    In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported
    affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to
    be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable
    where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that
    the Proxy Error page was displayed.

    In Apache HTTP server 2.4.0 to 2.4.39, Redirects configured with mod_rewrite that were
    intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead
    to an unexpected URL within the request URL.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial
    of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to
    build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued,
    this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request
    over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer.
    Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory,
    CPU, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the
    RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty
    SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently
    this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

  description: |
    An issue was discovered in Squid 3.3.9 through 3.5.28 and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is
    configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the header Proxy-Authorization. It
    searches for certain tokens such as domain, uri, and qop. Squid checks if this token's
    value starts with a quote and ends with one. If so, it performs a memcpy of its length
    minus 2. Squid never checks whether the value is just a single quote (which would satisfy
    its requirements), leading to a memcpy of its length minus 1.

    An issue was discovered in Squid 4.0.23 through 4.7. When checking Basic Authentication
    with HttpHeader::getAuth, Squid uses a global buffer to store the decoded data. Squid does
    not check that the decoded length isn't greater than the buffer, leading to a heap-based
    buffer overflow with user controlled data.

    An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x through 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x through 3.5.28, and 4.x
    through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use Basic Authentication, the Proxy-Authorization
    header is parsed via uudecode. uudecode determines how many bytes will be decoded by
    iterating over the input and checking its table. The length is then used to start decoding
    the string. There are no checks to ensure that the length it calculates isn't greater than
    the input buffer. This leads to adjacent memory being decoded as well. An attacker would
    not be able to retrieve the decoded data unless the Squid maintainer had configured the
    display of usernames on error pages.

    Due to incorrect string termination, Squid cachemgr.cgi 4.0 through 4.7 may access
    unallocated memory. On systems with memory access protections, this can cause the CGI
    process to terminate unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service for all clients using
    it.

    The cachemgr.cgi web module of Squid through 4.7 has XSS via the user_name or auth
    parameter.

  description: |
    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream
    prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker
    requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They
    manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte
    chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU,
    memory, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles
    the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree.
    This can consume excess CPU.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a header leak, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and
    0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some
    implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the
    session dies. This can consume excess memory.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial
    of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to
    build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued,
    this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.

    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a
    denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request
    over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer.
    Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory,
    CPU, or both.

    net/url in Go before 1.11.13 and 1.12.x before 1.12.8 mishandles malformed hosts in URLs,
    leading to an authorization bypass in some applications. This is related to a Host field
    with a suffix appearing in neither Hostname() nor Port(), and is related to a non-numeric
    port number. For example, an attacker can compose a crafted javascript:// URL that results
    in a hostname of google.com.

    LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics
    script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the document it is
    launched from. LibreOffice also has a feature where documents can specify that
    pre-installed scripts can be executed on various document script events such as
    mouse-over, etc. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9848, to block calling
    LibreLogo from script event handers. However an insufficient url validation vulnerability
    in LibreOffice allowed malicious to bypass that protection and again trigger calling
    LibreLogo from script event handlers. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice
    versions prior to 6.2.6.

    LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics
    script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the document it is
    launched from. Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9848, to block calling LibreLogo
    from document event script handers, e.g. mouse over. However LibreOffice also has a
    separate feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be executed on
    various global script events such as document-open, etc. In the fixed versions, global
    script event handlers are validated equivalently to document script event handlers. This
    issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.

    LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can be
    executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is
    intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python
    sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address
    CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations
    on the file system could be executed. However this new protection could be bypassed by a
    URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url describing the script location
    is correctly encoded before further processing. This issue affects: Document Foundation
    LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.

    LibreOffice documents can contain macros. The execution of those macros is controlled by
    the document security settings, typically execution of macros are blocked by default. A
    URL decoding flaw existed in how the urls to the macros within the document were processed
    and categorized, resulting in the possibility to construct a document where macro
    execution bypassed the security settings. The documents were correctly detected as
    containing macros, and prompted the user to their existence within the documents, but
    macros within the document were subsequently not controlled by the security settings
    allowing arbitrary macro execution This issue affects: LibreOffice 6.2 series versions
    prior to 6.2.7; LibreOffice 6.3 series versions prior to 6.3.1.

    An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x
    before 2.2.4. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the
    html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a
    catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words()
    methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template
    filters, which were thus vulnerable.

    An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x
    before 2.2.4. Due to the behaviour of the underlying HTMLParser,
    django.utils.html.strip_tags would be extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs containing
    large sequences of nested incomplete HTML entities.

    An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x
    before 2.2.4. Due to an error in shallow key transformation, key and index lookups for
    django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField, and key lookups for
    django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField, were subject to SQL injection. This could, for
    example, be exploited via crafted use of "OR 1=1" in a key or index name to return all
    records, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the **kwargs
    passed to the QuerySet.filter() function.

    An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x
    before 2.2.4. If passed certain inputs, django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri could lead to
    significant memory usage due to a recursion when repercent-encoding invalid UTF-8 octet
    sequences.

    GNU patch through 2.7.6 is vulnerable to OS shell command injection that can be exploited

  description: |
    LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be
    executed on various document events such as mouse-over, etc. LibreOffice is typically also
    bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics script, which can be
    manipulated into executing arbitrary python commands. By using the document event feature
    to trigger LibreLogo to execute python contained within a document a malicious document
    could be constructed which would execute arbitrary python commands silently without
    warning. In the fixed versions, LibreLogo cannot be called from a document event handler.
    This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.5.

    LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only documents from locations deemed 'trusted'
    are allowed to retrieve remote resources. This mode is not the default mode, but can be
    enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources
    within a document. A flaw existed where bullet graphics were omitted from this protection
    prior to version 6.2.5. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior
    to 6.2.5.

  description: |
    As part of a winning Pwn2Own entry, a researcher demonstrated a sandbox escape by
    installing a malicious language pack and then opening a browser feature that used the
    compromised translation. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and
    Thunderbird < 60.8.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67
    and Firefox ESR 60.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    When an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of document.domain for
    cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use
    document.domain, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on
    the other subdomain, even those that did not use document.domain to relax their origin
    security. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird <
    60.8.

    POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect
    response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site
    Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox <
    68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in HTTP/2 when a cached HTTP/2 stream is closed
    while still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    Due to an error while parsing page content, it is possible for properly sanitized user
    input to be misinterpreted and lead to XSS hazards on web sites in certain circumstances.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    A vulnerability exists where the caret ("^") character is improperly escaped constructing
    some URIs due to it being used as a separator, allowing for possible spoofing of origin
    attributes. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird <
    60.8.

    A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use
    file: URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are
    known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored
    in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in
    combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent
    to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable
    pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim
    received from other correspondents. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox
    < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    A heap-buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Redis hyperloglog data structure
    versions 3.x before 3.2.13, 4.x before 4.0.14 and 5.x before 5.0.4. By carefully
    corrupting a hyperloglog using the SETRANGE command, an attacker could trick Redis
    interpretation of dense HLL encoding to write up to 3 bytes beyond the end of a
    heap-allocated buffer.

    A stack-buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Redis hyperloglog data structure
    versions 3.x before 3.2.13, 4.x before 4.0.14 and 5.x before 5.0.4. By corrupting a
    hyperloglog using the SETRANGE command, an attacker could cause Redis to perform
    controlled increments of up to 12 bytes past the end of a stack-allocated buffer.

    As part of a winning Pwn2Own entry, a researcher demonstrated a sandbox escape by
    installing a malicious language pack and then opening a browser feature that used the
    compromised translation. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and
    Thunderbird < 60.8.

    Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67
    and Firefox ESR 60.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we
    presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
    code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    When an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of document.domain for
    cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use
    document.domain, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on
    the other subdomain, even those that did not use document.domain to relax their origin
    security. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird <
    60.8.

    POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect
    response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site
    Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox <
    68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in HTTP/2 when a cached HTTP/2 stream is closed
    while still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability
    affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    Due to an error while parsing page content, it is possible for properly sanitized user
    input to be misinterpreted and lead to XSS hazards on web sites in certain circumstances.
    This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

    A vulnerability exists where the caret ("^") character is improperly escaped constructing
    some URIs due to it being used as a separator, allowing for possible spoofing of origin
    attributes. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird <
    60.8.

    A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use
    file: URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are
    known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored
    in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in
    combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent
    to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable
    pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim
    received from other correspondents. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox
    < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.
